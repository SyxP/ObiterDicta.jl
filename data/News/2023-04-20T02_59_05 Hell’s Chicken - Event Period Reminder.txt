Hell’s Chicken - Event Period Reminder

Greetings, Dear Manager.

With today’s scheduled update, the new content of 'Chapter 3.5: Hell’s Chicken' has been added. The event period is from Apr 20 (Thu) 12:00 to May 4 (Thu) 09:59 (KST).
You can redeem Hell’s Chicken event rewards from the [Coupon Trade-in] between Apr 20 (Thu) 12:00 and May 11 (Thu) 09:59 (KST).

You have 7 more days after the event’s end to claim the rewards, but once the page for the [Coupon Trade-in] closes, you will no longer be able to redeem the rewards.
Please mind the duration when you play the event.

※ Currently, the closure date for the [Coupon Trade-in] on its page is incorrectly displayed as May 10 (THU) 09:59 (KST); this will be corrected in the Apr 27 scheduled update.

Thank you.

PROJECT MOON
