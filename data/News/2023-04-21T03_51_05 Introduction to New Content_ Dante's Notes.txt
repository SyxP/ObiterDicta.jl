Introduction to New Content: Dante's Notes

Greetings, Dear Manager.

To accommodate for the changed schedule for Chapter 4, an event tied to a new feature, “Dante’s Notes”, will take place starting May 11th (KST).

*This image is for reference only; actual details subject to change.

In Dante’s Notes, you will be able to read the records on various points and keywords of the City’s setting observed and written from their perspective.

The entries will be updated as you progress through the story of Limbus Company and Dante sees and experiences more things. A log-in event tied to Dante's Notes will take place between May 11 and June 1 (KST); a new entry will be written into Dante’s Notes each day during the event period.

We will let you know of further details in a future notice. Thank you for your patience.
