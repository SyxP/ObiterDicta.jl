Claiming Rewards

- When you clear a stage, the station will record the number of turns taken to clear it Clear Turns and the cumulative amount of turns taken throughout the current expedition Total Turns.

- After clearing a stage in the line for the first time during the event period, the rewards will be sent to the Lost & Found.
To gain access to the Lost & Found, a number of Enkephalin Modules will be required. Afterwards, you may freely access it and claim the rewards you've earned without any additional cost.

Combat Details

*This image is for reference only; actual details subject to change.

- Every battle on the line adopts the Abnormality method of directly matching ally skills against enemy skills.

- The health and Sanity of the Sinners will carry over between stages. However, after clearing a stage, those who did not participate in the battle will fully recover their health and Sanity when entering the next stage.

- When a Sinner dies, they will remain unavailable for the rest of the expedition.

- E.G.O resources will carry over between stages.
- When you lose a battle, you will be taken back to the point right before entering the stage.
- During an expedition, you can choose to start over from any previous stage. When you do, the battle will start with the Sinners' lives and E.G.O resources reverted to that point, and any progress made for the stages after it will be lost.

- You may not change your team in the middle of an expedition. If you wish to modify your setup, you must start a new expedition.
