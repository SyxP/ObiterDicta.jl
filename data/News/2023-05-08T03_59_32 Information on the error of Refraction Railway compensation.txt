Information on the error of Refraction Railway compensation

Hello, this is Project Moon.

Since the update on May 4, we have confirmed that additional Refraction Railway compensation will be paid to some managers.

The problem was caused by the change of the compensation table under certain conditions due to the code added during the 5/4 update, and we have identified the current cause and completed the error correction.

In the case of this error, it is a compensation that is received immediately, not by mail, so we're very sorry to say that it is impossible to identify and retrieve the payment details at the moment.

In the case of mail, after the problem that mail items were paid twice, the compensation payment history was saved to make it possible to inquire and retrieve.

However, this error did not take into account the above duplicate payment problem on the Refraction Railway, so we did not save a separate detailed log of the compensation history. As a result, additional paid compensation cannot be recovered at the moment.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused in using the game due to the problem and for causing concern to the manager once again.

From now on, we will record the item collection log on all items so that we can take appropriate recovery measures when the same problem occurs.

We would like to offer you a small reward, although it's not enough for the disappointment you must have been felt.

We would appreciate it if you could refer to the details of the compensation below.
