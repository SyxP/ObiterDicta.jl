Notice: New Banner for
Season 4 Limbus Pass Package

We have decided that the Season 4 Limbus Pack's 'Season 4 Limbus Package Special Banner' does not have enough features to differentiate it from the banner obtainable via the Battle Pass. Therefore, we plan to include a new Banner in the Package.

The new banner will be added to the game after the April 11th (KST) Scheduled Update, and will be sent to the inbox of all Managers who have already purchased the Season 4 Limbus Pass Package.

In the same Scheduled Update, the same new Banner will be added to the Season 4 Limbus Pass Package. Managers purchasing the Season 4 Limbus Pass Package after the Scheduled Update can receive the preexisting 'Season 4 Limbus Pass Package Special Banner' and the newly added banner.

We will take care to make the design of these banners stand out more, to make them more worth it. Thank You.

Notice: New Banner for
Season 4 Limbus Pass Package

▶ When: After the April 11th, 2024 (KST) Scheduled Update
▶ How to obtain the new banner
    - If you have purchased the package before the April. 11th Scheduled Update:
      You will receive the new banner via the in-game Inbox.
    - If you purchase the package after the April. 11th Scheduled Update:
      The new banner will be included in the Season 4 Limbus Pass Package, alongside the preexisting banner.

Notice: An issue where the 'On Use' effect of an equipped Skill activates even when the unit is Staggered

We have identified and issue where, when a Clashing character gets Staggered before the Skill is used, the 'On Use' effect still triggers even when the Skill itself isn't used. This issue has been occurring for both allies and enemies, and it only activates under specific conditions in which the opposing character conducts an unopposed attack against a Staggered character.

Please refer to the information below for more details.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by this combat logic issue.

▶︎ Issue
- An issue where, under specific circumstances, the 'On Use' effects of an immobilized unit would activate

▶︎ Cause
- This issue was caused because certain combat logics from earlier in the game development were included without getting updated accordingly

▶︎ Solution
- Correct the combat logics in question

▶︎ Error Details
- Affected Units: Unit that is set up to Clash against the opposing unit in the Chaining Phase (Skill A VS. Opponent's Skil B set to Clash)
  - Condition: The unit gets Staggered before using the Skill
  - When: When the Unit takes an Unopposed Attack by the opponent's Skill B
  - Effect: The Unit's Skill A's [On Use] effect activates, even when Unit A is supposed to be immobilized due to Stagger. Other On Use effects owned by the Unit, such as E.G.O Gifts or Passives, activate as well.

▶︎ Effects affected by the error
※ Every effect that uses the [On Use] Condition from Skills, Passives, and E.G.O Gifts have been affected by this issue. We have compiled the most frequently used effects below.

- [On Use] Gain (buff) on self (Poise/Charge/Tremor Potency or Count, Haste, Charge Barrier, Magic Bullet, and more)
- [On Use] Inflict/Apply (effect) on target (Burn/Bleed/Rupture/Sinking Potency or Count, Charge Barrier, Assist Attack, Damage Up, Power Up, Offense/Defense Level Up, and more)
- [On Use] Gain Aggro to Skill Slot next turn/Apply Aggro to Skill Slot next turn
- [On Use] Discard certain Skill(s) or effects triggered from the Discard
  - [On Use] Heal HP or SP
  - [On Use] Inflict damage to self or the target
