Known Issues

▶ An issue where, in a certain Stage of Chapter 6 (Part 3), the lack of memory causes the game to crash

Currently, playing through a certain Stage of Chapter 6 (Part 3) with a device of the minimum RAM requirement (3 GB or less RAM) could cause the game to crash. We recommend playing on a device with 4 GB or more RAM for now.
We are currently undergoing the optimization process to reduce RAM usage in Combat Encounters; we will notify you via a notice in the future once it is complete.
