Planned Combat Adjustments

1. Resonance-based Offense & Defense Level Boost
- Sin Resonance will now boost the Offense/Defense Level as well.
  (Offense Level boost applies to Attack/Counter skills, 
   while Defense Level applies to Guard/Evade skills.)
- Absolute Resonance applies the highest level of the boost 
  to all resonating skills in the chain.

2. Defense Skill Changes
- Using defense skills in regular combat will no longer skip the unit's action.
- Defense skills will be able to redirect enemy skills in Abnormality battles.
- Guard and Evade skills will activate when the unit is about to be attacked by a skill 
  that would otherwise result in a Clash
  if they were not defending, rather than any attack.
- Counter skills maintain the same activation conditions.

3. Guard and Evade skills are now affected by character growth.
- Defense skills (outside of Counter) are affected by the Defense Level.
  - When using a Guard or Evade skill,
    its Power may increase or decrease based on the difference 
    between the attacking skill's Offense Level and the defending skill's Defense Level.

4. Changes to Stagger
- The turn-based action slot additions on the Dashboard will 
  prioritize non-Staggered units.
- There will be adjustments to the Stagger Thresholds of certain Identities 
  based on their intended roles and traits.
  (e.g. Tankers and Damage Sponges will have fewer thresholds.
  Offense-oriented characters may see little change to their Stagger Thresholds.)

5. Clashes will further boost the final damage.
-1% -> 3% damage boost per Clash.

â€» The listed adjustments are under development and 
  are subject to change during our internal testing.
  We will notify you of the finalized adjustments in a future announcement 
  around the time of the update.
