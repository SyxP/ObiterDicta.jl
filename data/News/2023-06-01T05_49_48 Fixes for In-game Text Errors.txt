[Fixes for In-game Text Errors]

Hello.
This is Project Moon.

We have confirmed various errors related to the in-game text and will work to fix them around 15:00 (KST). 

<Errors>
- Fixed an issue where the Japanese version of Stage 4-1's story had the wrong speaker displayed for dialogue.
- Fixed an error where Yi Sang's name in certain standing images was erroneously spelled as LEE SANG.
- [Additional] Fixed an issue where part of Stage 4-17's Japanese translation was in Korean

The fix for the previously noted issue of the game not functioning on Android must undergo the Android review process and is unlikely to finish within the day.
As soon as the review is complete, we will do our best to get the update on live servers ASAP.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
