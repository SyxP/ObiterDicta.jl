Notice: Issues Identified after
Mar. 28th Scheduled Update

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We would like to inform you about the two issues
that have occurred after the Mar. 28th Scheduled Update.

<Issues>

1. An issue where Dead Rabbits Boss Meursault's SP Loss Conditions
lists an SP loss condition from 'Blade Lineage Mentor Meursault'

2. An issue where clearing 6-16 does not yield
Account EXP or Identity EXP

We plan to conduct a hotfix today around 16:30 to fix the
above issues. The hotfix will be deployed upon restarting the game,
and it does not require a client update. Please note that,
however, additional in-game downloads will occur.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
