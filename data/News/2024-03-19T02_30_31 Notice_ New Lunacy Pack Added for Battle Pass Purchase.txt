Notice: New Lunacy Pack Added for Battle Pass Purchase

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We sincerely apologize for causing managers concern regarding the change in the Battle Pass purchase method.

Our intent in changing the Battle Pass purchase method from cash purchase to 1300 Paid Lunacy purchase was to unify the currency needed to purchase the Battle Pass and other Packages, making product refund processing and management more efficient.

A new 1300 Paid Lunacy Pack for the Battle Pass purchase will be added with the Season 4 Update.
This Pack can be purchased only once every Season, and will cost exactly the same as the previous Battle Pass price.

Battle Pass Paid Lunacy Pack
(Name subject to change) Notice
Contents: Paid Lunacy x1300
Price: ₩15,000 / $10.99 / ¥1,500
(Same as the current price of the Battle Pass)
Can be Purchased: Once per Season
Update Schedule: After Mar. 28th 2024 (KST) Scheduled Update

We will remind you of the above information again via the Season 4 Scheduled Update Notice.

Thank You.
