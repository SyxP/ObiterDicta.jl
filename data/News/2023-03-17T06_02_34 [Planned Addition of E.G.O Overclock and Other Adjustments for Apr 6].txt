Planned Addition of E.G.O Overclock
and Other Adjustments for Apr 6

Greetings, Dear Manager.
Below is a list of planned additions and a
adjustments to E.G.O expected to be applied on Apr 6th, 2023 (KST).

1. New Feature

E.G.O OVERCLOCK

E.G.O Overclock will be a feature
that allows the user to induce E.G.O Corrosion at will.
With overclocking, you can manually generate a Corrosion skill
by spending 1.5 times the required E.G.O resources and SP.
It is also possible to overclock an E.G.O skill
using the base E.G.O resource cost,
but this results in an Unstable E.G.O Overclock,
binding you in E.G.O resource-debt and making the skill volatile.

(1) E.G.O Overclock (Stable)
If you overclock an E.G.O skill
with enough E.G.O resources in your possession,
it becomes a <Stable Overclocked E.G.O Skill>.
Stable overclocked E.G.O skills have the same effects
and damage values as the corrosion skill
while being able to distinguish friend from foe.

(2) E.G.O Overclock (Unstable)
If you overclock an E.G.O skill while you lack the E.G.O resources for it,
it becomes an <Unstable Overclocked E.G.O Skill>.
In this case, the E.G.O resource cost will be subtracted
from your possession past 0, making it go into the negatives.
Unstable overclocked skills carry
the risk of targeting indiscriminately as well.

2. Changes to Sin Resistance Modification when using E.G.O Skills

◆ Current Iteration
When using an E.G.O skill, only the better resistance values from the E.G.O will override the unit's current resistances.

◆ After Update
When using an E.G.O skill, the E.G.O's resistance values completely override the current ones regardless of if they are more advantageous.

We will give you a more detailed notice on April 3rd (KST).
Thank you.
