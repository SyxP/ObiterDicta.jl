5. New Combat Feature - E.G.O Overclock
- When generating an E.G.O skill, you can manually generate a Corrosion skill by spending 1.5 times as many E.G.O resources and SP.

- With enough E.G.O resources in your possession, the skill becomes a <Stable Overclocked E.G.O skill>. Stable overclocked E.G.O skills have the same effects and damage values as the corrosion skill while being able to distinguish allies from foes.

Overclocking while you don't have enough E.G.O resources in your possession results in an <Unstable Overclocked E.G.O skill>. In this case, the E.G.O resource cost will be subtracted from your possession beyond 0, making it go into the negatives. Unstable overclocked skills carry the risk of targeting indiscriminately as well.
