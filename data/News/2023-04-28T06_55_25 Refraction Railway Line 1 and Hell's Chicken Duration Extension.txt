PROJECT MOON
Refraction Railway Line 1 and Hell's Chicken Duration Extension

The exorbitant amount of currency required relative to the event's duration resulted in much more fatigue than we initially anticipated.

As such, we have decided to extend the duration of the ongoing events by two weeks in accordance with the delay of Chapter 4.

The extension will be applied with the May 4th update.

Please note the changed schedule when you plan and play the event. We will try to provide a better experience in future events.
