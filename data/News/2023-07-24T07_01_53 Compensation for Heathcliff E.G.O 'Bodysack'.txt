Compensation for Heathcliff E.G.O 'Bodysack'

Greetings, this is Project Moon.

We apologize to any Managers that have Threadspun Heathcliff's 'Bodysack' to Tier 4.

As we correct our labeling mistake, we understand that we should have considered if such changes would be acceptable to our Managers. We again apologize to any Managers that Threadspun Heathcliff's 'Bodysack' to Tier 4 after looking at its mislabeled description.

By way of our apology, we would like to compensate all Managers for the costs that have gone into Threadspinning Heathcliff E.G.O to Tier 4.

From now on, we will take greater care in taking into consideration what effects such mistakes and fixes would have on players' experiences regarding characters' capacities, and we will further diligently verify our future updates to ensure that similar labeling mistakes may not be repeated.
