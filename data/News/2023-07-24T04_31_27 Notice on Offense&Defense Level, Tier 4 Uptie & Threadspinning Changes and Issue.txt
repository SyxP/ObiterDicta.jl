Notice on Offense & Defense Level, Tier 4 Uptie & Threadspinning Changes and Issues 

Greetings, this is Project Moon.

We have identified several issues with the capabilities of several Identities and E.G.Os that arose after the Offense & Defense Level changes and Uptie 4 & Tier 4 Threadspinning update.
The issue will be addressed with the July 27th Scheduled Update.

We sincerely apologize for causing inconveniences regarding the Identities and E.G.O capabilities.

From now on, we will make sure to more carefully review our update contents regarding character capabilities so that no similar incident will occur again in the future.
And if there are any further statistical adjustments in the future, we will be sure to inform you of the details before the update.

1. Adjustments to Identities and
E.G.O Offense and Defense Levels

After this update, Identities and E.G.Os that had their Offense & Defense Levels reduced in the last update will be re-adjusted.
We apologize for causing confusion and disappointment from their reduced Offense & Defense Levels.

The Offense & Defense Levels have been adjusted to match the values of the previous version at Level 35,
And Identities & E.G.O Skills with Growth stats of 0.8 or higher have gained an additional Level.
Moreover, for characters with significantly lower Offense & Defense levels, we have raised their stats to match their original visions better.
