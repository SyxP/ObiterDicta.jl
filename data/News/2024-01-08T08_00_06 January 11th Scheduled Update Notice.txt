※ This change is not limited to Burn or Bleed. If any new indirect ways of applying other Status Effects are added to the game, they will be categorized as [Unique Status Effects] as well.

Bug Fixes & Improvements

► Standardized Skill text regarding Skill effects that cause SP damage
- Before : Deal N SP damage / (Same in English) / X loses N SP
- After : Standardized to “Deal N SP damage”
※ Affected E.G.O list
- Faust E.G.O ‘Fluid Sac’, Don Quixote E.G.O ‘Fluid Sac’, Ishmael E.G.O ‘Capote’, and Rodion E.G.O ‘Pursuance’
- This does not change the actual effects of the E.G.O.

► R Corp. 4th Pack Reindeer Ishmael’s Skill 3 - Mind Whip description clarified
- Before : At less than X Charge Count, target a random unit for an unopposed attack
- After : At less than X Charge count at Combat Start, target a random unit for an unopposed attack
- This does not change the actual effects of the Skill. The text was adjusted only to clarify the activation timing of the Mind Whip Skill.

► Fixed an issue where ‘Rodion E.G.O - Pursuance’ showed the unique E.G.O Background even when it was under Threadspinning Tier 3

► Fixed an issue where the E.G.O Gift Enrapturing Trance did not activate properly upon [When hitting an enemy with a Skill]

► Fixed an issue where, in the ‘Sell E.G.O Gifts’ menu while the Starter Buff ‘Namesake’ was activated, the prices did not update accordingly to the modifiers

► Fixed an issue where exiting after attempting to turn ON/OFF the Starter Buffs in the Mirror Dungeon caused an error

► Fixed an issue where attempting to use ‘Wish of a Star’ under a specific set of conditions caused an error

► Improved the 000 Identity Uptie cutscene from Tier 2 to Tier 3 so that it would display the Spine animation instead of a static image

► Fixed an issue where the ‘Abnormality - Ambling Pearl’ Encounter would leave surviving summoned units under a specific condition

► Improved the Dispenser UI so that items that cannot be dispensed would display the ‘Cannot Purchase’ label

► (EN, JP only) Fixed an issue where the Main Story Canto IV - 54 cutscene displayed an incorrect location in certain scenes

► Fixed an issue where the Boss enemy in Main Story Canto V - 10 would not show the proper animation upon death

► (KR only) Improved certain dialogue texts in the Kurokumo Wakashu Rodion Identity’s Uptie Story
