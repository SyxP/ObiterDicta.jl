Notice Regarding Issue with Premature Display of UI for Certain Chapters

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We have identified an error where the chapter (Chapter 3.5) that should only be unlocked after clearing every stage in Part 1, Chapter 3 is being shown on the UI even when the condition is not met.

The error occurs after clearing every stage in Part 1, Chapter 2, and lasts until every stage in Part 1, Chapter 3 has been cleared.

The unintentionally unlocked stages cannot be entered until the player has cleared every stage in Chapter 3. You can enter the stages normally after clearing Chapter 3.

Please understand that this is a UI error and has no impact on the game progression.

The issue has been resolved and will be applied with the next update.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

PROJECT MOON
