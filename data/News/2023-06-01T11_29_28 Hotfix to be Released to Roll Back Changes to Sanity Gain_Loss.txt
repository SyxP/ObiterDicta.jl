Hotfix to be Released to
Roll Back Changes to Sanity Gain/Loss

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We have decided to roll back Sanity gain and loss
to be nearly the same as how it worked in previous versions.

- Sanity gain on clash win will now act similarly to before.
  (Amount: Base value 10, further raised
  by 20% for every clash after the first)

- Sanity loss on clash loss has been removed.

- Other factors such as defeating enemies,
  allies defeating enemies, or ally deaths will be adjusted to work
  as they did in previous versions.

We apologize for the faulty planning and premature implementation
of the changes without sufficient testing causing
unpleasant experiences to the players.

We would like to apologize for going back
on our previous notice as well.

To account for the ease of gaining Sanity,
we will try to approach the matter by encouraging
consideration for strategic use of E.G.O, rather than implementing
system rules to arbitrarily downadjust Sanity.

As adjustments to the values can be applied without compiling
new builds or going through market review processes,
we will implement the change at 21:00 (KST) today.
