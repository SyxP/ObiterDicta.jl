Major Changes

1. Refraction Railway Line 2 Banners’ Cycle Counts & Total Turns Text Location & Effects Adjusted

- After : [Cycle Count] on the bottom left, [Total Turns] on the bottom right of the Banner; glow effect added to the records texts

Bug Fixes & Improvements

▶ VFX settings changed
With these fixes, the older character resources will be updated; please note that additional downloads will occur.
(iOS: ~1.85GB, Android: ~2.37GB, Steam: ~2.29GB)

▶ Fixed an issue where Zwei South Section 4 Gregor, Zwei South Section 4 Faust's attack VFX did not show properly on mobile(iOS, Android)

▶ Fixed an issue where certain enemy skills in the Refraction Railway Line 2 were unaffected by Aggro
(1) An enemy Skill from Station 2 
(2) An enemy Skill from Station 4
(3) Station 5
- All Skills except 'Snagged Lure'
(4) Station 9
- Skills used by summoned units were properly affected by Aggro
- All Skills except 'Endless Blooming'

▶ Fixed K Corp. Class 3 Excision Staff Hong Lu's Support Passive description
- Before : [At the start of the next turn], give 2 K Corp Ampule to the ally with the lowest HP percentage.
- After : [At the start of the combat phase], give 2 K Corp Ampule to the ally with the lowest HP percentage.
※ The Support Passive in question was activated not [At the start of the next turn], but [At the start of the combat phase]. Since [At the start of the combat phase] is easier than [At the start of the next turn] to recognize the units targeted by the Support Passive, and because it activates earlier, we have adjusted the description text to match its current activation timing.

▶ Fixed an issue where Lobotomy E.G.O.::Sunshower Heathcliff's Combat Passive - 'Rain of Tears' did not activate its 'Protection' effect in the intended timing
- Before : While the Passive did apply 'Protection', Protection effects were applied only after this unit took the first hit
- After : When the Passive applies 'Protection', its effects are applied immediately, before this unit takes the first hit

Bug Fixes & Improvements

▶ Fixed an issue where the activation condition of Lobotomy E.G.O.:: Sunshower Heathcliff Uptie 4 Skill 2 - 'Puddle Stomp' wasn't calculated [On Use] but in real-time (e.g. If, after the combat phase began, Heathcliff's SP healed beyond -15 or -25 due to SP healing triggers such as winning a Clash, his Skill 2 effects would stop applying in the middle of the combat phase as opposed to remaining activated until the end of the combat phase.)

▶ Fixed an issue where Dieci Association South Section 4 Rodion's Support Passive's Blunt DMG Up maxed out at 5 instead of 3 as it is written
- Before : Maxes out at 5
- After : Maxes out at 3

※ Due to our insufficient testing, the Support Passive's Blunt DMG Up maxed out at 5 instead of 3 as it is written. If this incorrect value were to be left unchanged, it would provide a significantly more powerful damage buff than the other Support Passives, so it has been adjusted. We sincerely apologize to all Managers who have so far utilized Dieci South Section 4 Rodion's Support Passive. Going forward, we will make sure to scrutinize the updates for issues regarding max values in the testing process before release.

▶ Fixed an issue where the activation condition for the first Coin of Dieci Association South Section 4 Rodion Uptie 4 Skill 3 - 'Excruciating Study' was mislabeled
- Before : [Heads Hit] Inflict +4 Sinking Count
- After : [On Hit] Inflict +4 Sinking Count

▶ (JP Only) Fixed a typo on Dieci Association South Section 4 Rodion Uptie 4 Skill 3 - 'Excruciating Study'
- Before: [On Use] Discard "w" Skills of the lowest ranks in all of this unit's Skill Slots
- After: [On Use] Discard "2" Skills of the lowest ranks in all of this unit's Skill Slots

▶ Fixed an issue where the activation condition for the first Coin of Zwei Association South Section 5 Rodion Uptie 4 Skill 1 - 'Careful Obstruction' was mislabeled
- Before : [Heads Hit] Gain +1 Poise Count
- After : [On Hit] Gain +1 Poise Count

▶ Fixed two issues with Zwei Association South Section 6 Sinclair Skill 3 'Strong Strike'
- Fixed an issue where "If target has 5+ Tremor upon Tremor Burst, gain 2 Protection next turn" did not give this unit 2 Protection
- Fixed an issue where Tremor Burst on target activated twice instead of once

▶ Fixed an issue where the Identities' regular voice lines would
play even when under the effects of E.G.O Corrosion

▶ Fixed an issue where, if the user uses a Ticket to extract after viewing the 'Not Enough Lunacy' notification, the before-and-after values of using the ticket did not show properly

▶ (EN Only) Fixed a typo in the acquisition conditions of a Refraction Railway Line 2 Banner (which appears when pressing and holding the Banner)

Issues Currently Being Investigated

The following issues are currently being investigated. Once these issues have been resolved, we will inform you with a more detailed explanation of the fixes via update notices in the future.

▶ An issue where Passive activation calculation happened upon stage entry, before the unit speeds were determined.
This caused incorrect targets to be selected in the first turn by certain Support Passives with unit speed conditions.

▶ Targeting conditions when more than a single target fit the conditions for activating certain effects(Skill effects, Passives, Buffs, Enemy Skill targeting conditions, Abnormality Choice effects) will be changed
- Before: Applied in the order that the units are loaded
- After:
(1) Between Allies: Selected in the order in which the Identities were selected in the Team loadout menu
(Selects the Identity added to the Team first)
(2) Between Enemies & Allies: Selected Randomly
(3) Between Enemies: Selected Randomly
※ We would like to put more control in your hands when more than 1 ally fits the effect conditions, and clarify which ally the effects will target. We will do so by making it contingent on which unit you have selected first in the Team loadout menu.
(Units will be selected randomly in other cases)
