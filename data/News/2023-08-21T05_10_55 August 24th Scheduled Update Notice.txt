Bug Fixes and Improvements

   • Changed the effects of Uptie 3 Zwei Association
     South Section 6 Sinclair's Skill 3 'Strong Strike'

     - After: [On Use] Give 1 Protection to the ally with 
       the least HP ‘next turn’
     ※ The skill’s Uptie 3 activation timing has been changed to
       ‘next turn’ due to an error after the Uptie 4 update. Therefore,
       the description has been changed to match the current effects.
   • Fixed an issue where Uptie 4 Zwei Association South Section 6
     Sinclair's Skill 3 'Strong Strike' applied 1 Protection on this 
     turn and not ‘on the next turn’ as it is written
   • Fixed an issue where Uptie 4 LCCB Assistant Manager 
     Ishmael's Skill 1 'Shove' applied Coin Power +2 instead of
     Skill Power +2 as it is written
   • Fixed an issue where Don Quixote E.G.O - Fluid Sac's Passive
     ‘Waves of Depression’ was dealing Pride damage instead 
     of Gloom damage as it is written
   • Changed the target description for the Gloom damage effect
     of Don Quixote E.G.O - Fluid Sac passive ‘Waves of Depression’
     - Before: "Abnormalities take Gloom damage instead"
     - After: "Targets without SP values take Gloom damage instead"
   • Fixed an issue where Ishmael E.G.O - Ardor Blossom Star Tier 4
     Threadspinning Awakening skill's [Heads Attack End] effect would
     apply even when the coin lands on Tails.
   • Fixed an issue where the conditions for activating Ishmael
     E.G.O - Ardor Blossom Star passive ‘Shower of Fire’ 
     incorrectly included allies as well
