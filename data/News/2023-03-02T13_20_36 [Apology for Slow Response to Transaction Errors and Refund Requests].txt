Hello. This is Kim Jihoon, the Director of Project Moon.

To start off, we would like to apologize to our users playing <Limbus Company> for allowing frequent bugs and errors to seriously hinder the experience.

Our insufficient preparation caused disappointment to many players.

We will take responsibility for our shortcomings and make sure that every user who was unable to receive the items they paid for gets proper compensation, and we will make sure to take care of all refund requests even if the process takes time.

We understand that we have much to reflect on as our insufficient capabilities in terms of development and post-release response let many users down, especially since the interest people showed in <Limbus Company> far exceeded our expectations.

Learning from this experience, we will do our best to improve the customer service environment and design reasonable systems so that users may comfortably enjoy <Limbus Company>.

We are currently in the process of handling cases of transaction errors and refund requests reported via the customer service inquiries in order. Unfortunately, it will inevitably take some time to process everything and provide the necessary measures to all users.

We will do our best to address these issues for our users as soon as possible.

Once again, allow us to formally apologize to our users for the significant inconvenience.

We would like to thank all our users for their continued attention and love, and we will do everything in our power to provide a stable service.

Thank you very much.

PROJECT MOON
