Hello. This is Kim Jihoon of Project Moon.

Before I start, I would like to apologize to the worker who was harmed the most by the recent controversy.

And I would like to apologize to everyone for our belated official statement on the matter.

The notice took a long time to be prepared because of the legal consultation it required.

The following are clarifications on the facts regarding the recent controversy.

This was not a case of ideological investigation or unjust firing; the decision was made based on legal judgement and advice.
The company did not take issue with the ideological alignments of the worker, nor did it give them a notice of dismissal.

We would like to clarify that the company, employees of HamHamPangPang, and the relevant individuals harmed by the actions may take firm legal action against those who have made excessive verbal abuses, spread misinformation, attacked certain individuals within the company, or involved themselves in the attack by disregarding the NDA.

There are organizations, media, and people who are creating, spreading, and repeating false information without proper verification of the facts and only based on circumstantial evidence that the company took part in ‘ideological investigation’ and ‘unjust firing’. Please note that the company and the individuals who were defamed by such actions regarding this controversy may take steps for legal actions against them.

The spread of unconfirmed claims and speculations is causing severe harm to both the worker and the employees of Project Moon.

We urge you to refrain from propagating rumors that have not been proven to be factual.


We only wish that Project Moon is able to continue making and demonstrating games as we have until now.

Once again, we apologize for causing undue concern to many people as a result of this controversy.

Thank you for reading.
