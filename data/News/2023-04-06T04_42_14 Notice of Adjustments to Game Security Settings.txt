Notice of Adjustments to Game Security Settings

Greetings, Dear Manager.

With the Apr 6 scheduled update, a number of security measures have been applied to the game application.

Currently, the environments listed below will be prevented from playing the game.

- Macro Prevention: Macro-related applications must be removed from the device to access the game.
- Work Profile Secure Folder: The game cannot be accessed in a work profile environment.
- USB Debugging: The game cannot be accessed if USB Debugging is enabled in developer mode.
- Emulators: The game cannot be accessed while using certain emulators.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
