5. Major Changes
 
► Sanity will now be reduced upon using Sinners' starting E.G.O
※ Buffs are planned for certain starting E.G.O's upon
July's scheduled 4th Uptie & Threadspinning Tier 2 Update.

<Aims>
・Base E.G.O
Currently, the base E.G.O Sinners have by default costs no SP to use
and requires relatively few E.G.O resources, while still having similar 
Clash powers and effects as other E.G.O. To balance the base E.G.O
with the others, we are planning to add an SP cost to them, and
adjust some base E.G.O skills and passives that are considered to be weak.

5. Major Changes
▶ Changes to Faust E.G.O - Representation Emitter’s Coin Effect and Passive
<Aims>
- Faust's Base E.G.O [Representation Emitter] We plan to adjust Faust's base E.G.O as it is considerably more powerful than the other base E.G.O. In addition, we have decided to adjust the significant SP heal effect her base E.G.O has in order to prevent her from being considered an absolute must in gameplay contents.

1) Coin Effect
- Threadspinning Tier 1
Before: [After Attack] Heal 6 SP for all allies
After: [After Attack] Heal 8 SP for 3 other allies with the lowest SP

- Threadspinning Tier 3
Before: [After Attack] Heal 12 SP for all allies
After: [After Attack] Heal 10 SP for 3 other allies with the lowest SP

2) Passive
Before: Attack Skill’s Final Power +2. If 10+ turns into the battle, gain 2 Protection every turn, but lower Attack Skill Final Power by 2.
After: If an enemy is staggered during this unit’s attack, 1 ally with the lowest SP has +2 Heal Efficiency next turn. (3 times max per turn)

▶ Adjusted amount of SP regained when defeating an enemy of higher Level depending on Level difference
1) Defeated by this unit
- Before: Base 10 SP regained, additional 10 SP regained per 1 Level difference
- After: 10 SP regained regardless of Level difference

2) Defeated by an ally
- Before: Base 5 SP regained, additional 5 SP regained per 1 Level difference
- After: 5 SP regained regardless of Level difference
