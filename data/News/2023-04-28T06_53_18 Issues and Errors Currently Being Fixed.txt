Issues and Errors Currently Being Fixed

Greetings, Dear Manager.

We are currently in the process of identifying and resolving issues that have emerged with the Apr 27 scheduled update. We apologize for the inconvenience caused during the event period.

Fixes for the issues listed below will be implemented with the May 4 scheduled update.

The fixes will be coming in a scheduled update instead of a hotfix for the following reason. Earlier, we released a hotfix to address a number of issues. However, the hasty adjustments caused new issues in the process. Therefore, we deemed that sufficient testing will be required to ensure the bug fixes won't result in more issues before releasing the update. Please understand; we will try to see to it that the same problem does not occur in the future.

We once again apologize for the inconvenience caused by the issues; we will provide compensation to all players. Please refer below for the list of issues being worked on and details about the compensation.
