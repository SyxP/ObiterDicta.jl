UI/UX Improvements

1. Passives Panel Animation Simplified

※ Intent: By simplifying the Passives panel Animation, we widened the visible area in combat and reduced the amount of graphic resources it consumed.

2. Improved Press-and-hold E.G.O Overclock Activation

- Before: E.G.O choice window closes, and Overclocked E.G.O is immediately equipped

- After: E.G.O choice window doesn't close immediately; Overclocked E.G.O can be equipped with an additional press

Optimizations

1. In-combat rendering performance improvements

- Graphic resource usage lowered via Passives window simplification (lowered to 2.5 ~ 15% of resources used before)
- Deleted unused rendering camera objects

Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed typos in Seven Association South
  Section 4 Faust's Identity Story
- Fixed an issue where, in viewing Abnormality details during combat, the UI displayed "Destructible" even when the destructible Abnormality part was already destroyed
- Fixed an issue where, after a status effect was lifted, the Count lingered even after Potency is reduced to 0
- Fixed an issue where effects of Molar Boatworks Fixer Ishmael's Support Passive "Crab Driver" affected the ally with the highest HP instead of the ally with the lowest HP
- Fixed an issue where Corrosion Image did not show properly when viewing the E.G.O selection UI in combat
- Fixed an issue where, if the player changed a Skill that was already assigned to a target to a Defensive or an E.G.O Skill, other Skill Slots' UI(Sin Resonance, Favored & Struggling Text) did not update accordingly
- Fixed an issue where a broken part would become Staggered due to Tremor Burst
- Fixed an issue where, upon activating Sinking Deluge, Sinking values did not disappear

- Sinking Deluge Keyword was generated with an intent to spend all Sinking values at once to deal damage.
If this issue were to remain unfixed, Sinking would cause far too much consistent damage compared to other Keywords.
We sincerely apologize to any Managers who have been using the Sinking Deluge keyword so far, for taking so long after the Identity's release to fix this issue.
We will make sure not to make similar mistakes in the future with more rigorous tests. We again sincerely apologize for this mistake.
