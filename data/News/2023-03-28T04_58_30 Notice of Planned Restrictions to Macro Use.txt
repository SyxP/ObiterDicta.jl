Notice of Planned Restrictions to Macro Use

Greetings, Dear Manager.

A system to restrict the use of macros is coming into effect.

User game data will be monitored.
If certain data points exceed the average beyond our general criteria,
or if records of illegitimate play are identified,
the game account may be suspected of macro use
and face suspension without warning.

When a player's game account is suspended,
a notification detailing the reason for the suspension
will be sent to the email address linked with the game account.

If your account has been suspended despite playing the game normally,
please send an inquiry to limbussupport@projmoon.com.

Through continuous evaluation, we seek to ensure
that all users can enjoy the game on equal terms.

Thank you.

PROJECT MOON
