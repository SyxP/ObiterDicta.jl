2. Egoshards
Egoshards can be used for the notated period, matching the Season’s duration. When a new Season begins, half of the previous Season’s Egoshards will be carried over, converted and rounded up for the new Season.
The carryover rates for unconverted Egoshards from multiple seasons past will be halved for each following Season. The remaining Egoshards are converted into Thread.

Season 2, Reminiscence
Half of the Egoshards you own will be carried over into the new Season.
