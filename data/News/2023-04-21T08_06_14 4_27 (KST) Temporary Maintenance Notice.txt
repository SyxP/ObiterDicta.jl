the game will temporarily enter maintenance.

The time of completion may vary depending on the situation.

[Update Contents]
- Addressed omissions and typos from the translation
- Fixed an issue where the image for R.B. Sous-chef Gregor was shown as a white blank when selecting support Identities

In addition, we would like to provide an additional compensation for the delay in the roadmap.
Please refer to below for more details
