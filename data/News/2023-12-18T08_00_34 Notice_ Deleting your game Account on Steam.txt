Notice: Deleting your game Account on Steam

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We plan to add a function to delete your game account on the Steam version.

Update Schedule
- When: After Dec. 28th (Thu) 12:00 (KST) Scheduled Maintenance
- Supported Versions: 1.33.0 or after

Currently, in order to delete your account, you had to first link your account with the Mobile platforms first before deleting your account.
In order to make account deletion easier, we plan to add a UI in the Steam version so that you can delete your account on Steam version of the game without linking it to a Mobile version.

â€» Upon Account Deletion request, you will have 7 days to revert your decision.
After 7 days, the account linked to the Mobile version will be deleted as well. After your account is deleted, you can create a new game account on Steam version of the game by restarting the game.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
Thank you.

PROJECT MOON
