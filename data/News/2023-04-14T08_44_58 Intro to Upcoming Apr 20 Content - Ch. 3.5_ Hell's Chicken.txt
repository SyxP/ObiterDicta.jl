Hell's Chicken Dungeons

The Hell's Chicken Dungeons play similarly to Mirror Dungeons.
The dungeon comes in two difficulties;
their major traits are as follows.

Normal (Mild)	Hard (Spicy)
Entry Cost	Enkephalin Module x1	Enkephalin Module x2
Identity Levels	Fixed at specific values	Uses Identities' actual levels
Step 1: 15	Step 1: Max 15
Step 2: 30	Step 2: Max 30
Identity Uptie Tiers	Uses Identities' actual tiers	Uses Identities' actual tiers
E.G.O Threadspin Tiers	Uses E.G.O's actual tiers	Uses E.G.O's actual tiers

※ Example: If a Level 20 Identity enters the Hard dungeon
- Step 1: Lv. 15 (Max level is set at 15)
- Step 2: Lv. 20 (Max level is set at 30; however,
the Identity's actual level is applied)

Several E.G.O Gifts from the Mirror Dungeon will appear
in the Hell's Chicken dungeon. These E.G.O Gifts will assist
event Identities and E.G.O to shine in their respective specialties.
