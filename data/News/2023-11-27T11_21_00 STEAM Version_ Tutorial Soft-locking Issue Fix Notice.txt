STEAM Version: Tutorial Soft-locking Issue Fix Notice

Greetings, this is Project Moon.

We have identified a Tutorial soft-locking issue in version 1.28.0, and have corrected the issue.
This issue occurred only on the STEAM version of the game.
Please refer to the information below for more details.

Issue
An issue where, during the Loadout tutorial, UI became inaccessible and soft-locked the game
An issue where, during the Extraction tutorial, repeatedly pressing the Space or the Enter shortcut key would soft-lock the game

Causes
The interactable areas were incorrectly delineated while developing the UI animations
Repeated shortcut key inputs were not made to properly interact with the Tutorial progress

Error Fix
Adjusted interactable area
Added a function to prevent repeated shortcut key inputs

Future Measures
Because there were many special functions and behaviors that went into making the tutorials, adjusting unrelated areas of the game may cause it to act in unintended ways. We will make sure to conduct tests for the Tutorials as well if we go through further UI changes during the development of the game.

We apologize for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
