1. New Mini-event: New-hire’s Attendance Rewards
[Details]
1. The total amount of Enkephalin spent on all contents such as stages, dungeons, and Luxcavation will be tallied, and various rewards will be provided after reaching set milestones.
2. Using an Enkephalin Module will count as 20 Enkephalin used.
3. Actions that don't actually "spend" Enkephalin, such as assembling an Enkephalin Module, entering the Mirror Dungeon for free with the daily free entry, and simulated dungeon explorations, will not count toward the tally.

[Event Period]
Mar 23 12:00 ~ Apr 6 09:59 (KST)

There are two sets of rewards that can be earned from the event: Part 1 and Part 2.
Rewards for Part 2 can be redeemed after Apr 1 00:00 (KST). Both parts use the same Enkephalin tally for milestones.
If you have spent enough Enkephalin to reach milestones for Part 2 before it's unlocked, you can immediately claim the rewards after it unlocks.

- Part 1 Final Rewards: Special decorative banner #1 + Decaextraction Ticket
- Part.2 Final Rewards: Special decorative banner #2 + 3★ Guarantee Decaextraction Ticket

6. Major Changes

► System

- The maximum amount of Enkephalin Modules one can possess is now capped at 999.
It is possible for the number of Enkephalin Modules owned to temporarily surpass 999 when Modules are acquired from mails, pass rewards, event rewards, and other sources.

- Resonance now boosts the skill's [Offense/Defense Level] rather than [damage]
- Absolute Resonance applies the highest level of the boost to all resonating skills in the chain

► Combat System - Defense Skill Changes
- Using defense skills in regular combat no longer skips the unit's action, and the skill now properly corresponds to the enemy skill
- Defense skills can now redirect enemy skills in Abnormality battle
- Guard and Evade skills now activate when the unit is about to be attacked by a skill that would otherwise result in a Clash if they were not defending
- A "defending level" has been added to Guard and Evade skills of all Identities, similar to offense levels for attack skills
- Adjusted Power values of defense skills
- When the defense skill's defending level is higher than the offense level of the attacking skill, the defense skill's Power is boosted. (1 Power per 5 levels of difference)
- Growth for max health and defense level of Identities changed to use the same formula
- A unit's defense level reflects the defending level of the defense skill they last used

► Combat System - Predicted Skill Values Display
- A skill's minimum and maximum damage values are now shown before targeting, when targeting with defense skils, and performing an unopposed attack

► Combat System
Stagger thresholds of all Identities adjusted to better suit their roles
