Notice : Issues Currently Being Investigated

Greetings, Dear Manager.

We have identified the following additional issues after the Refraction Railway Line 2 update.

1. An issue where all rewards, regardless of the unlock conditions, were unlocked upon clearing the Terminus (Station #9)

Currently, there is an issue with Refraction Railway Line 2 where rewards for Stages that the Managers did not complete are getting unlocked.

We are working on a fix for that issue at this moment, And Refraction Railway Line 2 reward claims for all Managers will be temporarily paused until the fix is deployed.

If the rewards for uncleared Stages are unlocked in your Lost & Found, Or if you have already claimed them, they will be withdrawn once the fix is deployed.

We apologize for causing an issue with reward claim in this event. We will post an additional notice once the fix is deployed.

2. An issue where a certain Abnormality's Passive would activate at an incorrect timing

There is an issue with the Abnormality on Station #2, where its Resistance changes are applied not on 'next turn' but 'this turn'. This issue will be fixed with the Sep. 21st (KST) Scheduled Update.

Also, the permanent Resistance change with that Passive is an intended effect, And the description for that Passive will be updated for clarity.

We apologize for the inconvenience that our unclear passive description caused.

3. An issue where Molar Office Fixer Outis and Yi Sang's Identity details did not specify the Season

Molar Office Fixer Outis and Yi Sang are Season 2 Event Identities, And their descriptions will be fixed with the Sep. 21st (KST) Scheduled Update.

We will continue to update you with notices once additional issues are identified. We sincerely apologize for causing inconvenience to your enjoyment of our game.
