PROJECT MOON
Notes on the Event’s Purpose

\[Walpurgis Night\] is an Extraction Event where E.G.O equipment from \<Lobotomy Corporation\>, E.G.O Pages from \<Library of Ruina\>, certain Guests from \<Library of Ruina\>, and in the future, characters from \<The Distortion Detective\> may appear; it is an Extraction season where various characters and elements from the wider Project Moon universe appear as Identities or E.G.O.

While the periods between these Events may vary, our current goal is to hold at least 1 \[Walpurgis Night\] Event every quarter. In future \[Walpurgis Night\] Events, we plan to add Event-specific stories and unique combat encounters to the game as well.

This Event was planned to demonstrate interesting scenarios involving numerous characters and stories that have appeared in the expanding Project Moon universe, such as Abnormality hunts with specialized Teams made purely of identities using Lobotomy Corp. gears.

Please look forward to future \[Walpurgis Night\] events where Identities and E.G.O from various timelines converge.
