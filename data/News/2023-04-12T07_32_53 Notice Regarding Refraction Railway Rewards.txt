Notice Regarding Refraction Railway Rewards

Greetings, Dear Manager.

Refraction Railway Line 1 will close on May 4 09:59 (KST).
The reward items for clearing stages on the Line are stored in the Lost & Found. If you have used Enkephalin Modules to gain access to the Lost & Found at some point during the event, any items still unclaimed by the time the Line closes will be sent to you through the in-game mail system. If you have not used Enkephalin Modules to gain access to the Lost & Found by the end of the event, you will not be able to claim them when Line 1 closes. Please be mindful of this.

Refraction Railway Line 2 is planned to be added during Season 2, and the projected time of arrival may change depending on the progress of development.

Thank you, and happy travels.
