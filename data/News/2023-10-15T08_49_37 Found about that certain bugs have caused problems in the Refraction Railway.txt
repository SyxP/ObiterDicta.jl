!!! Machine translation was used for quick notice. !!!

Currently, we have found that certain bugs have caused problems in the play and recording of the Refraction Railway

We will quickly re-examine the build and revise it after reproducing the bug, identifying the cause, and correcting it as an update.


We will select abnormal records of players who abused the bug separately and take time to remove the records and recover compensation.


We will take my time to find out more about the specific notice and fill it out within tomorrow to inform you.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
