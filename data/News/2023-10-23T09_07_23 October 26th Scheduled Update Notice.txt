Optimizations

1. Improved resource loading speed in the game's UI
Resource loading speed has been improved for viewing certain menus such as the Team Menu, Extract, and Drive and its Canto I~IV Selection Menu.

2. Deleted ~1.1GB of unused resources

UI/UX Improvements

1. Identities & E.G.O detailed information popups improved

- Intent: We have added a 'Summary' tab to reduce the number of steps required to access the E.G.O details from the Identity details menu. We have also redesigned the current old-school, folder-like UI to a more solid, vintage mechanical design.

2. UI for viewing equipped E.G.O and Identity Skill Info from the Team Menu added

- Intent: We have added these functions so that players can view all Identities' Skill Damage Types, equipped E.G.O, E.G.O resources that can be gained by Identities, and E.G.O resources used by E.G.O Skills at once.

UI/UX Improvements

3. UI Behavior for Deploying & Dismissing Identities changed

- Intent: In the older version of the Team Menu, behaviors for switching out an Identity and deploying an Identity to combat were rather confusing. The separate 'Edit Team' button on the bottom right added unnecessary steps to the process. That button has been removed in favor of clarifying the difference between the behavior for switching out an Identity and the behavior for deploying Identities to battle.

※ Tutorials for 0-2, 0-3, 0-4 Stages, Team Menu, Identity Details, E.G.O Details have been updated accordingly.

4. Stage Clear Results UI Redesigned

- Intent: As previously mentioned in UI/UX Improvement #1, we have redesigned the current UI to a more solid, vintage mechanical design. Stage Clear Results UI has been updated accordingly as well.

UI/UX Improvements

5. Mirror Dungeon Preset function improved
- Intent: The old Preset function simply reloaded the last-used Team loadout, which meant that it was cumbersome when trying to employ a variety of Team loadouts. In order to reduce the unnecessary steps to changing your presets, we have made changes to the Preset function so that you can swap out your Team based on Teams you have made in the 'Sinner' window.

6. Abnormality Focused Encounter 'Staggered' label added to Skill Slots in Staggered Abnormality parts

- Intent: We have added this label resource to clarify Staggered parts of the Abnormality.

Major Changes

1. Dante's Notes -
Adjusted certain categories' arrangement orders
Certain categories' arrangement orders have been changed so that spaces between words would not come before ㅂ,ㅏ, or ㄷ.

Bug Fixes & Improvements

▶ Fixed an issue where, when a Notice or a Dispenser popup would appear when the Banner was showing the red exclamation symbol in the Window’s User Banner section, the Banner's symbol would be overlayed on top of the popups

▶ Fixed an issue where "Let one person drink it all" choice in a Mirror Dungeon Event didn't work as intended
   - Before: The first effect was applied to the selected Sinner, and the second effect was applied to a different Sinner after the results were calculated again
   - After: Both effects are applied to the selected Sinner

▶ Fixed an issue where if, at the point in which the Mini Episode is updated, the player did not meet its unlock conditions, but met the conditions later and unlocked the Mini Episode, then watched the Mini Episode in the Theater, the Mini Episode would still play automatically upon startup.
   ▶ Fixed an issue where, in the JP build of the game, the symbol (学) did not display properly

▶ Fixed an issue where, upon entering the fourth phase of the Doomsday Calendar and failing the choice Event, the HP loss displayed in the choice results screen did not match the actual HP loss. (Effective values are unchanged)

▶ (EN Only) Fixed an issue where Blade Lineage Cutthroat Outis's Skill 1 'Draw of the Sword' was mislabeled as "At 5+ Poise, Coin Power +3"
   instead of "At 5+ Poise, Coin Power +1
   - Before : At 5+ Poise, Coin Power +3
   - After : At 5+ Poise, Coin Power +1
(Effective values are unchanged. We apologize for causing confusion with the incorrect translation. Going forward, we will more diligently proofread our translations.)

Known Issues after Oct. 26th Update

▶ An issue where viewing Identity or E.G.O details from the popup menu that appears after using Yisang (Ideality) to extract would cause the game to lock due to the lack of a button to exit the details menu

This issue will be corrected upon the next Scheduled Update. Please note that viewing Identity or E.G.O details from the aforementioned popup menu will cause the game to lock.
