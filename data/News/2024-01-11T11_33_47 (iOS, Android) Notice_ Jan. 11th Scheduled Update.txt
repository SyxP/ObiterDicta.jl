Hello, this is Project Moon.

2 pressing issues among the issues we have identified after the Jan. 11th Scheduled Update have been fixed, and the fix has been uploaded to the respective stores at 20:30 (KST).

Please download the update from the respective stores. Once the game has been updated, the bottom right side of the Title screen should say 'Version 1.34.1'.

Please note that continuing to play the 1.34.0 version of the game without updating the client will trigger an error. 

[Fixed Issues] 
- (Focused Encounter) When an enemy that is scheduled to attack is killed, the game freezes.
- An issue where using the skip battle function in the Thread & EXP Luxcavations caused the UI to glitch

We sincerely apologize for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
