Notice on Postponement of Updates after Chapter 4

Greetings, Dear Manager.
The planned release dates for major content updates after Chapter 4 main story updates have been postponed as listed below.

<Mirror Dungeon #2>
Old: Jun 22
New: Jun 29

<Mirror Dungeon #2 Hard>
Old: Jun 29
New: Jul 6

<Refraction Railway Line 2>
Old: Sometime in July
New: Sometime in August

The changes were made for the following reasons:

As development time originally reserved for future content has beenMallocated to polishing Chapter 4 main story contents, we've decided to delay Mirror Dungeon #2's release in order to secure the content's quality. As for Refraction Railway Line 2, we have postponed its release until Chapter 4.5 to balance the difficulty with the upcoming Uptie and Threadspin Tier in mind and refine the new enemies.

To make up for the postponement, we will do our best to ensure that the content we deliver is fun.

Thank you.

PROJECT MOON
