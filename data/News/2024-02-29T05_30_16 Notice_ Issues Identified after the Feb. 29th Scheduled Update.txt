[Notice: Issues Identified after the Feb. 29th Scheduled Update]

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We would like to inform you of the issues that have been identified after the Feb. 29th Scheduled Update.

1. An issue where acquiring an Announcer does not make them immediately available in the Loadout menu

This issue occurred due to the Main UI not updating immediately after acquiring the Annoucner.
This can be amended by moving to a different screen(Cutscenes or Encounters) from the Main UI, or by restarting the game. Once you have done so, the Announcer you have acquired will become accessible.

Issue
- An issue where acquiring an Announcer via a Pack or the Dispenser purchase did not make the Announcer equipable in the Loadout menu

Cause
- Announcer Purchase & Acquisition has been processed, but the in-game loadout UI did not update immediately
- The above issue was caused by an error that occurred while we were optimizing the loadout menu logic.

Solution
- This can be amended by moving to a different screen(Cutscenes or Encounters) from the Main UI, or by restarting the game. 
(Once the player views the loading screen at least once after acquiring the Announcer)
- This UI update issue will be corrected with the next Scheduled Update (Mar. 7th, 12:00 (KST))



2. An issue where the Popup UI close function does not function properly

Issue
- An issue where the in-game Popup UI does not close when clicking(or touching) outside the Popup window

Cause 
- This issue was caused due to an error that occurred while optimizing the Popup UI for more convenience
- Lack of sufficient testing for the above function

Solution
- We have corrected the logic so that the Popup UI closes properly
- This issue will be corrected with the next Scheduled Update (Mar. 7th, 12:00 (KST))


We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
