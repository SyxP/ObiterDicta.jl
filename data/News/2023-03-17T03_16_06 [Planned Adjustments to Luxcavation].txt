Planned Adjustments to Luxcavation

Greetings, Dear Manager.
Below is the list of planned changes
for Luxcavation that will be applied in a future update.

Updates

1. Entering Luxcavation now costs
Enkephalin Modules instead of Enkephalin.
Planned Date: Mar 23 (KST) Scheduled Update

◆ Current Iteration
- Experience Luxcavation Stage 1: 30 Enkephalin
- Experience Luxcavation Stage 2: 35 Enkephalin
- Experience Luxcavation Stage 3: 40 Enkephalin
- Thread Luxcavation Stage 1: 35 Enkephalin
- Thread Luxcavation Stage 2: 40 Enkephalin

◆ After Update
- Experience Luxcavation Stage 1/2/3: Enkephalin Module x2
- Thread Luxcavation Stage 1/2: Enkephalin Module x2

As the amount of Enkephalin spent is increased, the experience gain
from Stages 1 and 2 of Experience Luxcavation will be slightly increased.
(No changes will be made for Thread drops in Thread Luxcavation.)

2. Removal of Daily Bonuses
from Experience Luxcavation and the Standardization of Rewards
Planned Date: Mar 30 (KST) Scheduled Update

Experience Luxcavation will be tweaked to better serve
as a constantly available resource
where Identity Training Tickets can be acquired as needed.
To this end, the daily bonuses will be removed from Experience Luxcavation,
and regular clear rewards will be improved accordingly.

♦ Experience Luxcavation Stage 3
<Current Iteration>
- With Bonus (First 3 daily clears):
Identity Training Ticket III x5, Identity Training Ticket II x5
- Without Bonus (4+ per day):
Identity Training Ticket III x3, Identity Training Ticket II x3

<After Update>
Daily Limits Removed
- Identity Training Ticket III x4, Identity Training Ticket II x4

♦ Experience Luxcavation Stage 2
<Current Iteration>
- With Bonus (First 3 daily clears):
Identity Training Ticket III x3, Identity Training Ticket II x3

3. A 'Skip Battle' function will be added to Luxcavation.
Planned Date: Apr 6 (KST) Scheduled Update

- After clearing a stage in Experience Luxcavation,
  the ability to skip the battle for it will be unlocked.
- Using 'Skip Battle' will automatically clear
  the selected Luxcavation stage once.
- 'Skip Battle' costs twice as much Enkephalin as regular stage entry,
  but it yields 50% additional rewards.
  (The entry cost and rewards will reflect the changes above.)

<Example>
- Using 'Skip Battle' for Experience Luxcavation Stage 3
  (With mentioned changes applied)
  - Entry Cost: Enkephalin Module x4
  - Rewards Earned: Identity Training Ticket III x6,
    Identity Training Ticket II x6

Thank you.
