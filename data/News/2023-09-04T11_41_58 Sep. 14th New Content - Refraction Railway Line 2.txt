Refraction Railway Line 2

※ The above image is for demonstration purposes only and is subject to change before the official release.

- <Refraction Railway Line 2> will open after completing Main Story 3-22, and can be accessed via the 'Drive' menu.

- Line 2 will feature a total of 9 high—difficulty encounters. There are a total of 8 Stations, and upon completing the 8th Station (Transfer Station), thus completing a single Revolution(and at 1 or more Revolutions), the 9th Station(Terminal Station) will activate.

- As long as Line 2 is active, it can be accessed anytime without spending any resources. Line 2 will close upon the opening of <Refraction Railway Line 3>.

- You can spend a certain number of Modules(only the first time) at the Lost & Found to claim your Refraction Railway rewards.

- Upon entering, you will choose your Identities and E.G.O. to begin the expedition with. Unlike other combat-based content, any changes made to your Identities and E.G.O.’s levels, Uptie Tiers, and Threadspinning Tiers after starting the run will not immediately be reflected on your active team in the Railway. The upgrades will be applied upon beginning a fresh new run, however.

Combat Details

※ The above image is for demonstration purposes only and is subject to change before the official release.

- All encounters will be Focused Encounters where you, the Manager, will manually match your allies' skills against the enemies' skills.

- A maximum of 7 Sinners may enter an encounter. Although you may do so with fewer than 7 Sinners, they will not gain additional Skill Slots.

※ Intent: In Line 1 and other encounters, selecting fewer than 7 Sinners meant that each Sinner could receive more than a single Skill Slot.
(Example: Selecting 5 Sinners in a Focused Encounter with max 7 Sinners meant that a new Skill Slot would be added with every turn, eventually adding up to 7 Skill Slots)

In Line 2, Skill Slots will be identical to the number of selected Sinners.
(Example: Selecting 5 Sinners in a Focused Encounter with max 7 Sinners means that no new Skill Slot would be added, and will remain at 5 Skill Slots)

The previous system where each turn added a new Skill Slot added an element of uncontrollable randomness, which meant that unintended, unlucky retries could occur in this endgame content.

After applying this method, we will analyze play data and experiences and take into consideration any feedback to evaluate if the game systems are working as intended or if the changes made the experience less enjoyable.
Based on this data, we will continue to adjust our systems to provide our users with new enjoyable endgame content in the future.

Combat Details

- The Identities' HP, SP, Speed, Skills on the Dashboard, used Skills of individual Identities, and remaining Skills will carry over to the subsequent encounter.

- Starting a new stage loads in the information saved from the last, and the Speed of your Identities & Enemies will be saved.

  - Forfeiting a stage will revert you to the state immediately before entering that Station.

- Your Identities' HP, SP, Speed, Skills on the Dashboard, Used skills, and enemy Speed at the start of the stage will not change upon forfeiting and re-entering a stage.

※ Intent : Before this, the goal of the players was to repeat every stage multiple times and reroll Skill Slots until an ideal set of skills was rolled for the best possible result.

However, we have determined that having to reroll and reload every single encounter only caused unintended exhaustion and a sense of frustration.

Therefore, we decided to modify the system so that users wouldn't have to reroll every single stage to get an ideal result. In the first turn of the first stage of Refraction Railway Line 2, it is possible to reroll the first set of Skills by canceling Railway entry and restarting.

- Upon defeat, you may either revert to the state immediately before entering the stage or continue with the remaining IDs.
  Should you choose to continue,
  your enemies' HP will not recover, and the remaining HP percentages of your enemies in the stage will be displayed above the respective nodes.
  
- You can not change your Identity or E.G.O loadout once the Refraction Railway Run has started.
