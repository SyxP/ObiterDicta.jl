[Notice: Missing Sounds from the Android Build Fixed]

Hello,
This is Project Moon.

We have corrected the sound issue that occurred on Android devices after the Jan. 04th, 2024 (KST) Update.

Cause
- This issue was caused by sound resources loading from the incorrect file path upon entering the title screen
- Occurred during the sound resource path effectiveness evaluation process in the pre-update procedure

Solution
- We have reconstructed the file designating the sound resource loading path.
- Closing and restarting the game will download the reconstructed file, and the sound files will now load from the proper file path.
- Download size popup will not appear with this hotfix; about 4mb of additional download will occur.

Future measures
- We will add a step in the pre-update evaluation procedure to verify that the sound file path is set correctly, so that no same issue will occur again.

â€» If you are currently playing the game, please close and restart the game to apply this hotfix.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
