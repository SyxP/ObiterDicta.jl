List of Issues Identified as of Aug 10 Update

Greetings, dear manager.

The following is a list of known issues and errors that have been identified as of today through the QA process and player reports.

List of Known Issues

• (Japanese Language) Issue with Zwei South Section 4 Faust's Skill 2 'Client Protection' where the amount of Defense Level Up shown in the description is incorrect
- The correct version is '[On Use] Apply "4" Defense Level Up to the ally with the lowest HP percentage (3 times per turn)'.
• Issue where the damage number display for counters shows the damage dealt as "0" (Damage is dealt normally; emerged with the Aug 10 update)
• Issue with W Corp. L2 Cleanup Agent Faust's Skills 'Leap' and 'Overcharge' where the descriptions say Charge is spent instead of Charge Count
• Issue where the effects of G Corp. Head Manager Outis' Combat Passive 'Morale Boost' does not apply to herself
• Issue with function of Zwei South Section 5 Rodion's Skill 'Focused Defense' at Uptie Tier 4:
- '[On Use] At 15+ shield, gain +2 Poise Count' applies Poise Count next turn rather than this turn
→ The effect will apply on the same turn after the fix.
- Issue where the effect '[Heads Hit] Gain 1 Poise Count' is functioning as '"[On Hit]" Gain "2" Poise Count'
→ The effect will follow the description after the fix.
• LCB Sinner Sinclair - Issue where the Skill 'Ravaging Cut' applies Rupture Count on Heads hit at Uptie Tier 4
• Kurokumo Wakashu Hong Lu - Issue where the effects of his Combat Passive 'Dark Cloud Blade' are being applied to wrong skills
• Skill effect descriptions for LCB Sinner Hong Lu's 'Dual Strike' and 'Whirlwind', Lobotomy Corp. Remnant Faust's 'Opportunistic Slash', and certain enemy skills to be adjusted to better match their actual activation conditions
(The actual effect will remain the same; parts of the descriptions mentioning "last turn" will be adjusted.)
