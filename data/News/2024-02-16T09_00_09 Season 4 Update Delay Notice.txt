Season 4 Update Delay Notice

Hello, this is Kim Jihoon, director of Project Moon.

I regret to inform you that the Season 4 Update has been delayed.

I would first like to apologize for not only this delay notice but also for the frequency of our delays. I have disappointed you.

It is due to my shortcomings that, according to our internal review, there are inadequacies in the story and the cutscenes that need to be addressed.

That is why we have decided to delay the Season 4 Update.
In that process, we conducted an internal discussion regarding our scheduling and the quality of our update, which in turn delayed our decision to postpone the update and the notice regarding that decision.

Season 4 update will be delayed for 2 or more weeks from March 14th, which was the date posted on the Season 3 Pass.
After next week's Scheduled Update, Season 3 Pass UI's Pass end date will be changed to 'Before Season 4 Update'.

We will inform you with a PV and a more concrete schedule regarding the Season 4 Update as soon as we can lock down a date.
I will try my absolute best to make this delay count and improve both our scheduling and development so that we can deliver entertaining content.

I sincerely apologize for the frequent delay notices.
Me and the team will try our best so that, in the future, no such delays will occur.

PROJECT MOON
