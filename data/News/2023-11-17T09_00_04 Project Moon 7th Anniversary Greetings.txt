Project Moon 7th Anniversary Greetings

Hello. This is Kim Jihoon, the Director of Project Moon.

I would like to say a few words for Project Moon's 7th anniversary.

Our entire journey from November 18th, 2016, to 2023 was made possible only thanks to the fans who have enjoyed our games. Thank you so much.

I regret to say that due to several constraints, despite meeting our 7th anniversary, I don't have any news befitting the occasion to share with the fans at the moment.

However, I would like to inform you of the upcoming roadmap for Limbus Company and our future development directions.

So far, our goal has been to record voices for every major story content in the game. But doing so has inevitably caused our development cycle to slow, with many empty periods between every new content.

Because we want to share more tales of the City and the Limbus Company with greater variety and frequency, we plan to forego recording voices for the 'Detour Tales', where we introduce new stories and combat encounters.

Before this change in direction, we had one mini-episode (the x.5 Chapters) and a set of combat encounters per Chapter. Going forward, however, I would like to introduce two mini-episodes and sets of combat encounters for each Chapter.

Our voice recording efforts will be focused entirely on the Main Story. This is in order to release the mini-episodes and combat encounters more frequently, even if it means that the mini-episodes will be unvoiced.

Due to my inadequacies, we have been unable to abide by the Limbus Company roadmap we have previously revealed. I believe it would be more appropriate for us to show future content that will be added to the game, instead of a roadmap with concrete schedule deadlines.

Project Moon 7th Anniversary Greetings

Currently, the two-track game development that I have previously mentioned in a QnA is not in our plans. 
I would one day like for us to develop a 3D single-player game, but for now, we are focused entirely on the development of Limbus Company. This is so that our game studio will last longer, so that we may be able to go further.

Again, I want to thank everyone who's loved and supported us and our work. We will continue to endeavor to bring interesting stories and games for you to enjoy.
