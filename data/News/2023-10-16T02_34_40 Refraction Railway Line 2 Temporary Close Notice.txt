Refraction Railway Line 2 Temporary Close Notice

Hello, this is Project Moon.

In order to prevent the Refraction Railway Line 2 error from being used to gain Banners and Rewards in an abnormal manner, we have decided to temporarily close Refraction Railway Line 2 until Oct. 19th (KST) Scheduled Update.

We have identified the cause of the error in question, but fixing it requires a client build.

Because client builds can be deployed only after passing the store reviews, the issue cannot be corrected before the Scheduled Update; this may lead to additional incidents of exploiting this error. To prevent such an incident, we have decided to temporarily close Refraction Railway Line 2 until Oct. 19th (KST) Scheduled Update.

You can continue your run once Refraction Railway Line 2 opens again. Your current progress will be retained.

We will provide you with an additional notice detailing our additional measures regarding this error today. We sincerely apologize for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
