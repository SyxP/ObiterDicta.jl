                                                         Weekly Bonuses

<Intent>
We intend to alleviate the stress and time investment involved
with playing Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard by reducing the number of
repeated runs while maintaining the same amount of rewards.

Though the number of times in which the rewards
can be collected per week has been reduced,
the number of Enkephaline Modules consumed and
the amount of Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard rewards remains the same.

Please note that the Weekly Bonus and Hard Difficulty
rewards will not be reset upon this update.

Collecting a single Hard Difficulty reward between
6:00 ~9:59 (KST) on July 20th will reduce the number of
collectable Hard Difficulty rewards to 0.

Please take care to refrain from collecting
your Weekly Bonus and Hard Difficulty rewards
during that time period.
