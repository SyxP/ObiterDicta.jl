Notice of Emergency Update

[Maintenance Period]
- 2023. 4. 7(fri) 19:40 ~ 20:20 (KST)
- Update Compensation: Lunacy x1300
- The update completion time may vary depending on the maintenance situation.

We have identified an issue where Clashes occur at an unnaturally high frequency, and discovered upon examining the cause that the Sanity of Abnormalities could rise under certain conditions. Normally, enemy units whose Sanity is not displayed, such as Abnormalities, have a fixed chance of 50% to land Heads with their Coins.

An emergency update will be rolled out to resolve this issue as we have deemed that its impact on gameplay, especially on the Refraction Railway, is severe enough. As such, the game will enter maintenance in order to prepare for the emergency update.

We were able to prepare the emergency update quickly as the causes of the issues were identified early. In addition, the screening processes for Google and Apple finished earlier than predicted, allowing us to release the update with haste.

Please note that the time taken for the screening processes for future updates may differ, meaning we may not be able to deliver patches as fast.

If a similar major issue occurs in the future, the Steam version will most likely be the first to be updated as it does not require screening processes. Once again, please understand that we do not have the capability to release simultaneous patches for the mobile versions.

We will try to be more careful so that fewer serious issues like this arise in the future. We greatly apologize for the inconvenience.
