Notice: Mirror Dungeon Level Cap

Greetings, dear Manager.

Season 4 Clear All Cathy will be released with the Mar. 28th (KST) Scheduled Update.

As we have informed you in the Guide on Season 4, clearing the Main Story Chapter 5 will unlock the Identity level cap from 40 to 45.

If you have not completed Main Story Chapter 5, the Identity level cap will remain at 40 even after the Season 4 update. Once you have cleared Main Story Chapter 5, the Identity level cap will be unlocked.

However, [Mirror of the Lake Normal]'s fixed Identity levels and [Mirror of the Lake Hard]'s Identity level cap (not counting dungeon modifiers) will remain at 40.

Please note that the fixed Identity levels(normal) and Identity level cap(hard) in the upcoming 'Mirror of the Wuthering' will both be raised to 45.
