Notice on Delay to the Upcoming Content

Greetings, this is Project Moon.

Regrettably, we would like to inform you that the upcoming Refraction Railway and Canto 5 Update schedule has been delayed.

Due to recent issues, following our previously established roadmap became difficult, and our update schedule had to be adjusted. We sincerely apologize for the delays.

We will notify you with a new roadmap as soon as we are able to stabilize our developmental process. The following are the information that we are able to provide at the moment.

Currently, we aim to release Refraction Railway Line 2 within September, and we aim to release Canto 5 within November. As soon as our developmental process is stabilized, we will make sure to provide you with an updated roadmap once again.

We apologize for causing our players concern.

Thank You.

PROJECT MOON
