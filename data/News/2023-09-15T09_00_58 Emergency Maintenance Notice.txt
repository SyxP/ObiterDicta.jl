Emergency Maintenance Notice

Hello, this is Project Moon.

Currently, there is an issue in the game where Slash, Pierce, and Blunt DMG Up and Down effects are applied tenfold.
This issue may cause certain Identities and E.G.O to deal abnormal amounts of damage.

Unless this issue is immediately addressed,
We decided that the records between Managers who were affected by this issue and Managers who were not may differ.

Therefore, we plan to conduct an emergency maintenance, temporarily pause the Refraction Railway, and make a correction to this issue.
We will inform you of the detailed fixes and the error compensations once we have completed the maintenance.

We sincerely apologize for causing disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
