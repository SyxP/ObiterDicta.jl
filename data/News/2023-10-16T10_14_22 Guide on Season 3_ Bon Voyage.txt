1. Season 2 Egoshard Carryover

Guide on Season Changes - Egoshards

- When a new Season begins, half of the previous Season's Egoshards will be carried over (and rounded up).
- The carryover rates for unconverted Egoshards from multiple seasons past will be halved for each following Season.
- The remaining Egoshards are converted into Thread.
- Egoshard Crates (both random and nominable) will be carried over in the same way.

As per the information above, half of the currencies listed below will be converted to Season 3’s.
- Season 2 [Sinner]’s Egoshards
- Season 2 Egoshard Crate
- Season 2 Nominable Egoshard Crate

The carryover of currencies to Season 3 will automatically occur the first time you log into the game during Season 3. A popup will show how much Season 2 Egoshard relevant currency you owned, and how they have been converted.

※ Season 2 Identity Egoshard currencies that are still in the Mailbox or in the Lost & Found will be carried over when are claimed.

Carryover to Season 3 currency will occur as soon as they are claimed, and currencies that were not carried over will be converted to Threads.
