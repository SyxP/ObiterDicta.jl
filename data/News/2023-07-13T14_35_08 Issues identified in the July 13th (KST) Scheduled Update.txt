Issues identified in the July 13th (KST) Scheduled Update

We have identified the following issues in the July 13th (KST) Scheduled Update:

► Incorrectly marked Growth Rate values of E.G.O Skills
We have identified an issue on the July 13th update in which the Growth Rate of all E.G.O Skills are displayed as 0.2.
(This issue only affects how the Growth Rates are displayed, and their actual values were correctly applied)

This issue is localized entirely in the non-combat E.G.O information UI, and the E.G.O information UI that can be viewed during combat displays the correct Growth Rate values.
Issue #1 will be addressed with the next scheduled update on July 20th.

► Inability to enter certain encounters in Mirror Dungeon 2 Normal Difficulty
- Error Cause: This issue was caused by the changes to the Mirror Dungeon encounter data included in this update
- Error Condition: Starting Mirror Dungeon 2 before maintenance (06:00~10:00(KST)) and resuming after update

The update data will be properly applied only after restarting the current run of the Mirror Dungeon. Managers experiencing Issue #2, please restart the current Mirror Dungeon in order to address this issue.

► Incorrect rendering of [R Corp 4th Pack Rhino Meursault] SD image Hotfix notice
We have identified an issue in which the 3rd skill of [R Corp 4th Pack Rhino Meursault] does not render properly.

This issue occurred on the iOS platform, and has been addressed today via a hotfix.

We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused by these issues.
