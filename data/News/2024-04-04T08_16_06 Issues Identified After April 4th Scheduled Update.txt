We plan to deploy a hotfix for these issues around 18:30(KST) today.

The hotfix does not require a separate update; restarting the game will deploy the fixes. However, do note that the hotfix will require additional in-game downloads.

We will inform you via an additional notice once the hotfix is complete.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
