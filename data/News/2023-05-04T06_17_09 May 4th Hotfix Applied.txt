[May 4th Hotfix Applied]

Greetings, Dear Manager.

Version 1.6.0 of the Steam version had an issue that prevented the combat sprites of "The One Who Shall Grip Sinclair" and "N Corp. Mittelhammer Don Quixote" from being displayed.

We have identified the issue with the combat sprite resources and have fixed it accordingly.

If you're using the Steam version, please update the game client.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
