Event Gameplay

For two weeks, from July 27 12:00 to Aug 10 09:59 (KST),
you can earn [Bus-modifying Scrap] by clearing stages and
dungeons in the event and main story. [Bus-modifying Scrap] are
rewarded based on the amount of Enkephalin consumed.
There are stages in the S.E.A Event that are made to be played
repeatedly. Because they have a higher Enkephalin-to-
[Bus-modifying Scrap] ratio, they are much more effective
sources of [Bus-modifying Scrap]. Some stages will open up only
when you have collected a certain amount of [Bus-modifying Scrap].

▶ Where to collect [Bus-modifying Scrap]

- S.E.A Stages
- [Bus-modifying Scrap] are rewarded based on
  the amount of Enkephalin consumed
- EX Clear rewards an additional batch of
  [Bus-modifying Scrap] (One time only)
- Repeated Stages will have increased drops of Bus-modifying Scrap
 - Stages with Boss enemies will have increased drops of
    Bus-modifying Scrap

- Main Story Stages & Dungeons
- [Bus-modifying Scrap] are rewarded based on the amount
  of Enkephalin consumed

※ Mirror Dungeons and Luxcavation do not give [Bus-modifying Scrap].
※ The final stage that appears after finishing the story of
   S.E.A event is a stage that has a high Enkephalin-to-
   [Bus-modifying Scrap] ratio, and will disappear once the event is over.
   This stage does not count towards the Chapter Completion rewards.

▶ Special Scraps

Stages where you can gain [Bus-modifying Scrap] also has a small
chance to drop [Rare Horseshoe with Bus-modifying Scrap].

The drop rate for [Rare Horseshoe with Bus-modifying Scrap] is
higher in S.E.A Event Stages than it is in Main Story missions.

This item will immediately be exchanged to 20 [Bus-modifying Scrap]
upon completing the stage or the dungeon in the results screen.
