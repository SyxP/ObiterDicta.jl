Notice of postponement of Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard release

Greetings, dear manager.

The Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard Update schedule has been changed.

- Before: July 6th (KST) Update
- After: July 13th (KST) Update

After an internal testing and discussion of the Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard, we decided that the upcoming content's polish and fun factor was inadequate.
Since it is a significant update, we resolved to delay the release and go through further testing in order to provide a high quality content. We sincerely apologize for the delay.
We will try our best to deliver an entertaining experience with the delayed schedule.

Changes regarding Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard will be relayed via a notice this coming Friday.
