Library Of Ruina Bonus Coupon Code
Exchange Notice

Greetings, Dear Manager.

After the April 25th Scheduled Update, on Version 1.45.1, you can use the 'Input Coupon Code' function in-game to input the bonus coupon code included in the "physical copy of the Library of Ruina Console version".

You may input the code freely on Android and on STEAM, but due to the iOS platform policy, the in-game code input function will not be supported for the iOS version of Limbus Company.

We have prepared a website to input and receive the bonus coupon code included in the "physical copy of the Library of Ruina Console version", and we are currently in the process of testing its functionalities. It will be made available on May 2nd, 12:00 (KST).

We will inform you again via an additional notice before the website is made available, in which we will share the website's link and instructions on how to redeem your code.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
