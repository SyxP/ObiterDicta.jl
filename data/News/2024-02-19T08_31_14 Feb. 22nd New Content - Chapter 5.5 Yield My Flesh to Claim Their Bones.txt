Event Gameplay

<Bloodied Scabbard>
► Combat Encounters of ‘Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones’
You can obtain [Bloodied Scabbard] every time you complete a combat Encounter of ‘Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones’. Each Encounter has a first-time reward, and with it you can obtain even more [Bloodied Scabbard].

The final Stage of ‘Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones’ is a repeatable Dungeon, and is similar in progression to a Mirror Dungeon. That final Stage will have a higher Enkephalin-to-[Bloodied Scabbard] ratio, so it will be much more effective as a means of collecting [Bloodied Scabbard].

※ Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones Event Dungeon
Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones Dungeon takes after Mirror Dungeon 3 - Mirror of the Lake.
The Mirror of the Lake Starter Buffs do not apply within the Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones Dungeon, and the following will apply to all runs.

- Starting E.G.O Gifts
- Gift Appearance Rates: The same as unlocking [A Journey's Start] and all of its secondary Buffs
- Starting E.G.O Gift for each category: 3
- Appearing Gifts: Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones exclusive E.G.O Gifts + All Mirror Dungeon E.G.O Gifts

- Shops
- Gift Appearance Rates: The same as unlocking [Seize the Opportunity(Floor 4~5 Rates)] and all of its secondary Buffs
- Gifts on Display per Visit: 5 Gifts

These are identical to unlocking [A Journey's Start], [Fruits of Labor], [New Discovery], [Seize the Opportunity(Floor 4~5 Rates)], and [Just In Case] Starter Buffs down to the Secondary Buffs. In the Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones event Dungeon, the Shop and the Rest Stop will be available immediately before the Boss room, in that order.

Mirror Dungeons

During the Event Period, 'Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones' combat Encounters and Events will appear in the Mirror Dungeon.
※ You will be able to experience Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones event combat Encounters and Events regardless of your Main Story progress.

On the final floor of a Mirror Dungeon run, you can choose between the previously existing Mirror Dungeon final boss encounters and the Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones final boss encounter.
Selecting the Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones final boss encounter will net you even more [Bloodied Scabbard].

Spending the Hard Difficulty Rewards chance for the week will net you much more [Bloodied Scabbard].
※ If you claim the rewards without using the Hard Difficulty reward chance for the week, your Hard Difficulty Rewards will be the same as the Normal Difficulty Rewards, just like the Pass EXP gain.

During the event period, the Shop and the Rest Stop will be available immediately before the Boss room of the Mirror Dungeon Normal Difficulty as well.

Main Story (Canto 1 ~ Canto 5.5 Miracle in District 20)
