[Notice on Issue with Sin Affinity Power Up/Down Status Effects]

An issue where certain status effects that increase or decrease Power for a Sin Affinity can increase or decrease damage to abnormal degrees will be fixed with the June 29th update.
Currently, 'Wrath/Sloth Power Up/Down' status effects are increasing or decreasing the damage by N * 100% rather than increasing or decreasing the Power by N.
The list of affected skills is as follows:
Capote for Meursault
Sunshower for Yi Sang

The cause of the issue has been identified and addressed today on June 19th, and because a client build is required to implement the fix, it will be addressed with next week's scheduled update on June 29th.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
