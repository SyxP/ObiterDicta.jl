Notice: Missing Story Error

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We have identified an issue where, in the Story Dungeon at 5-36, the story cutscene 5-55 does not play.
We have identified the cause of the issue and have corrected it. However, deploying the fix requires a client build - and will be deployed with the next week's Scheduled Update.

Cause

Playing the story does not activate automatically in every rooms of a Dungeon; it is something that must be manually added to each respective rooms that play Story cutscenes.
A new type of room was added in the Canto V Story Dungeon, which moves the player to the next Floor without triggering any specific event. However, the function that plays a Story cutscene was missing, which meant that we failed to check if that relevant Story cutscene was working as intended.

Solution

We have manually added a function to play a Story cutscene to the new type of room that moves to the next Floor without triggering any specific event.

We sincerely apologize for this mistake and for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
As it is a very important part of our game, we will more carefully proofread and test it in our development process.
