STEAM Version: Tutorial Soft-locking issue and Temporary Solution Notice

Greetings, this is Project Moon.

We have identified an issue in the STEAM version of the game, where the game would soft-lock in the Tutorial.
The details are as follows.

Issue
Players are unable to select Faust's Portrait in the Sinners Loadout menu during the Tutorial, soft-locking the game.

Cause
This issue was caused by the selectable area being incorrectly designated during the Tutorial UI animation.

Getting past the soft-lock
1. Force close game
2. Select the SKIP button to skip the Tutorial before the Tutorial guides the player to entering the Sinners Loadout menu

We sincerely apologize for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.

We will re-build the Steam version and test it to see if the issue has been corrected, and will post an additional notice as soon as the changes are applied.

All Managers will be compensated for this issue, so please refer to the next page for more information.
