Notice of Upcoming Adjustments
to Passive Activation

Greetings, Dear Manager.

For the April 6th update, the activation conditions
for Passive Abilities will be adjusted to be easier.
Below are the planned changes and their intended purposes.

Aims

- To allow Passive Abilities to activate more frequently
and emphasize a choice between E.G.O skills and Passive Abilities,
we intend to adjust their requirements for activation.

Planned Changes

- The activation requirements of certain Combat
and Support Passives will be adjusted.
- Certain Passives will change to activate
based on the number of E.G.O resources in possession.
- Certain Passives may receive little to no change in activation requirements.
