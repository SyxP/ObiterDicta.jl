Hello, this is Kim Jihooon, director at Project Moon.

I'm afraid I have unfortunate news to share about this year's April Fools' Day event, especially since so many people were looking forward to it.

My wish is that we could provide you with an entertaining April Fools' Day event every year. However, I made a decision to fully focus on our upcoming content, considering the tone of the ongoing Main Story and our development schedule.

Because we were fully focused on developing and realizing the Main Story and the Mirror Dungeon, we could not prepare a separate in-game event for the April Fools' Day this year.

Therefore, we will try our utmost to prepare a plentiful and entertaining Season 4: Clear All Cathy.

Thank you.

PROJECT MOON
