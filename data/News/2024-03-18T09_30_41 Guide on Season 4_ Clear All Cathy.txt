2. Gradual Main Story & Battle Pass Updates

Chapter 6 of the main story and the
Season 4 Pass will be updated in 3 parts.

> 3/28
- Main Story Ch. 6 (Part 1)
- Season 4 Pass Rewards (Lv. 1 ~ Lv. 20)

> 4/4
- Main Story Ch. 6 (Part 2)
- Season 4 Pass Rewards (Lv. 21 ~ Lv. 40)

> 4/11
- Main Story Ch. 6 (Part 3)
- Season 4 Pass Rewards (Lv. 41 ~ Lv. 120 (Max Pass Level))
- Season 4 Pass Max Pass Level+ Rewards

Accumulated Pass Levels are tracked regardless of the
gradual updates. When the subsequent updates unlock the
rewards for higher levels, you can immediately claim
them up to your tracked Pass Level.

Max Pass Level rewards earned for leveling up the Pass past max
Pass level are also kept track of even when they aren’t unlocked,
and you can claim the accumulated rewards of Season 4 Nominable
Egoshard Crates immediately once they are made available.

Chapter 6 stage progression rewards and Max Pass Level rewards
will become available to claim on the April 11th update,
when (Part 3) of this chapter is added.

3. Battle Pass Changes

Battle Pass purchase method and price will be changed as follows.
- Before : Can be purchased with 15,000 KRW
  (Or 10.99 USD / 1,500 JPY)
- After : Can be purchased with 1,300 Paid Lunacy

Battle Pass Package price will remain unchanged.
- Price : 2,700 Paid Lunacy

If you have already purchased the Battle Pass, 
the Battle Pass Package price will be adjusted as follows.

Battle Pass Package, please note that purchasing the Battle Pass

new tab on the Dispenser: [Standard Fare - Announcers]
