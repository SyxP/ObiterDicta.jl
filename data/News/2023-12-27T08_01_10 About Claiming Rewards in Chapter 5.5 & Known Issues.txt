About Claiming Rewards in Chapter 5.5
& Known Issues

Greetings, dear Manager.

We would like to inform you about a few
things about Claiming the Event Rewards.

In [Chapter 5.5 - Miracle in District 20], you can obtain [Trinkets Sack]
when claiming Rewards in the Mirror Dungeon.
Using the Mirror Dungeon Hard Difficulty Bonus chance when
obtaining the event currency will net you even more event currency.
※ Using Weekly Bonus eligibilities, however, does not
affect the amount of event currency you gain.

Therefore, if you use your Hard Difficulty Bonus chance between
06~10 (KST) on Dec. 28th, you will not be able to claim the extra
event currency from the Hard Difficulty Bonus chance for that week.
This means that you will not be able to
claim as much event currency that week.

Managers planning to claim Mirror Dungeon Hard Rewards between
06~10 (KST) on Dec. 28th, please note the above information
before using your Mirror Dungeon Hard Difficulty Bonus chance.

Also, we are currently investigating the below issues.
We will inform you via a Scheduled
Notice as soon as these issues are corrected.

Known Issues

Machine' effect 'Next Turn Start: Each Identity gains (Total

activate for certain Identities (W Corp. L3 Cleanup Agent Ryoshu,

► (iOS, Android) An issue where the event

We apologize for the inconvenience.
