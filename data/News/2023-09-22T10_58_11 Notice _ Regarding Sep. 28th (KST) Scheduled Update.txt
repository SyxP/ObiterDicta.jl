Notice : Regarding Sep. 28th (KST)
Scheduled Update

Greetings, dear Manager.

We were able to safely wrap up the Business Days schedule of TGS thanks to much attention and support from our Managers.

We will try our best to show our appreciation by continuing to produce entertaining content. Thank you, always.

Today, at 23:00, a special Limbus Company video will be shown via the official TGS channel broadcast.

The special video contains a recollection of the journey our Managers have taken so far, and a sneak peek at the upcoming Canto V. Please enjoy.

Tomorrow is day 1 of TGS Public Day, and various commemorative goods have been prepared for people who visit our booth to play our game.

Due to our preparation for and participation in TGS, it is difficult for us to make additional changes & improvements to the game; therefore, there wonâ€™t be a Scheduled Maintenance on Sep. 28th (KST).

Please note that the next Scheduled Update will commence on Oct. 5th (KST).
