Greetings, Dear Manager.

The server will enter scheduled maintenance 
from 10:00 [AM] through 12:00 [PM] on Jan 18th, 2024 (KST). 
Please make note of the maintenance schedule; we recommend that 
you refrain from entering combat or making in-app purchases and 
close the application before maintenance begins so that no data is lost. 
Please refer below for details about the update.

Optimizations

1. [Friends -> Add a Friend] window optimized
Fixed an issue where having too many Friends in the Friends list 
caused the framerate to drop.

Bug Fixes & Improvements

▶ Fixed an issue where [Dark Flame]'s 'Turn End: 
Deal (Value x Burn on target) Pride Affinity damage, 
then expires' effect did not utilize the proper calculation 
formula for the intended damage output

▶ Fixed an issue where certain Identities' dialogue 
subtitles did not match the actual voice 
- Affected Identities : Lobotomy E.G.O.::Magic Bullet Outis, 
Lobotomy E.G.O.::Lantern Don Quixote

▶ (EN Only) Clarified the unclear 
Lobotomy E.G.O.::Magic Bullet Outis Skill 2 description 
- Before : [On Hit] At less than 4 Magic Bullet, gain 1 Magic Bullet. 
Inflict Dark Flame equal to Magic Bullet next turn
- After : [On Hit] At less than 4 Magic Bullet, gain 1 Magic Bullet; 
then, inflict Dark Flame equal to Magic Bullet next turn

Known Issues

The below issues are currently known,
and we are investigating solutions to each issue.
We will notify you via a notice as soon as they are corrected.

▶ An issue where, under certain circumstances,
relevant status effect UI triggers twice in a row
- Ex) When applying Sinking to a target that already has Sinking,
and if the target's Sinking does not completely expire after this hit,
the Sinking status effect UI is duplicated
※ This issue does not affect the actual damage output.
However, duplicate status effect damage UI caused
the Total damage UI to calculate the duplicate numbers as well,
making it seem as though certain attacks were causing
more damage than they actually did.

▶ An issue where, in the [Manager] menu or when selecting
the main Identity in the Window, categorizing by Identities
from Walpurgis Night did not include the Identities
from this Walpurgis Night
- Affected Identities : Lobotomy E.G.O::Magic Bullet Outis,
Lobotomy E.G.O::Lantern Don Quixote

▶ An issue where entering then exiting 'The Dawn of Green'
loadout menu, then entering the Refraction Railway loadout menu
caused the [Control Team Captain] buff UI to linger
※ This is a visual-only issue; the [Control Team Captain] buff isn't
actually applied to the Refraction Railway even if the UI lingers.
