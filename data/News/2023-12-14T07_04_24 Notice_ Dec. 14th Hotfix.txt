  Floor 3 Boss room would sometimes soft-lock the game,
  making it impossible to progress
- Fixed an issue where the music for a certain Mirror Dungeon #3
  encounter does not play
- Fixed an issue where the Mirror Dungeon #3 'Golden Apple'
  and the 'False Apple' bosses' stats reflected
  Thread Luxcavation stats

  Story Dungeon Encounter, a server error
  (Error code 75221) would occur

We sincerely apologize for these issues.
