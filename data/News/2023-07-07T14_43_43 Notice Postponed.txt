Hello, this is Project Moon.

The release of the notice <Mirror Dungeon #2 Hard Changes & Additions>, which was projected for today, has been postponed to Monday, July 10th (KST).

We have been continuing with internal tests and adjustments to Mirror Dungeon #2 Hard in order to polish the content further and reinforce its fun factors, but certain elements were still not fully set in stone, allowing us no choice but to delay the completion of the notice.

We'd like to apologize to the players who were waiting for the notice.

We will deliver the notice detailing the confirmed changes and additions for Mirror Dungeon #2 Hard next Monday.
