Hello,
This is Project Moon.

After the Jan. 04th, 2024 (KST) Update(1.33.1), we identified an issue on the Android build where the in-game sounds are absent from the game.
We are investigating if this issue can be resolved via a hotfix, and we expect this process to take about 2 hours. 

If this issue cannot be corrected via a hotfix, we will correct the game client and submit an additional Update(1.33.2) for review,
and will make sure that the users can download the newest version once the game client is updated.

We will post an additional notice once we have identified further details regarding this issue.

We will try our best to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
We sincerely apologize for causing a disturbance to your enjoyment of our game.
