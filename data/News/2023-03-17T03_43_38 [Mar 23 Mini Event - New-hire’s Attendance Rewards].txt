Greetings, Dear Manager.

On March 23rd, 2023 (KST),
the mini event <New-hire’s Attendance Rewards> will go live.
In <New-hire’s Attendance Rewards>, you can earn various resources based on the amount of Enkephalin and Enkephalin Modules you use during the event period.

Attendance
Rewards

2023. 3. 23 (THU) 12:00 - 2023. 4. 6 (THU) 09:59 (KST)

Event Details

1. The total amount of Enkephalin spent on all content such as stages, dungeons, and Luxcavation will be tallied,
and various rewards will be provided after reaching set milestones.
2. Using an Enkephalin Module will count as 20 spent Enkephalin.
3. Actions that don't actually "spend" Enkephalin,
such as assembling an Enkephalin Module,
entering the Mirror Dungeon for free with the daily free entry, and simulated dungeon exploration, will not count towards the tally.

Event Period

2023. 3. 23 (THU) 12:00 ~
2023. 4. 6 (THU) 09:59 (KST)

There are two sets of rewards that can be earned from the event: Part 1 and Part 2.
Rewards for Part 2 can be redeemed after Apr 1 00:00 (KST).
Both parts use the same Enkephalin tally for milestones.
If you have spent enough Enkephalin
to reach milestones for Part 2 before it's unlocked,
you can immediately claim the rewards after it unlocks.

- Part 1 Final Rewards:
Special Decorative Banner #1 & Dcextractraction Ticket
- Part 2 Final Rewards:
Special Decorative Banner #2 & 3✭ Guarantee Dcextractraction Ticket

Thank you.
