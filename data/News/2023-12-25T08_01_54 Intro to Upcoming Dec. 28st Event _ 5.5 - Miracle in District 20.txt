Event Gameplay

<Trinkets Sack>
For four weeks, from Dec. 28th 12:00 to Jan. 25th 10:00 (KST), you can earn [Trinkets Sack] by clearing stages and dungeons in the event and main story.

► Combat Encounters of 'Miracle in District 20'
You can obtain [Trinkets Sack] every time you complete a combat Encounter of 'Miracle in District 20'. 
Each Encounter has a first-time reward, and with it you can obtain even more [Trinkets Sack].

The final Encounter of 'Miracle in District 20' is a repeatable Encounter, and requires Enkephalin Modules to enter.
That final Encounter will have a higher Enkephalin-to-[Trinkets Sack] ratio, so it will be much more effective as a means of collecting [Trinkets Sack].

※ The Encounter will no longer be available after the Event, and clearing that Encounter does not count toward the Chapter Completion rewards progress.

► Mirror Dungeons
In this event, you can obtain [Trinkets Sack] every time you complete a Mirror Dungeon run. 
The higher you rise through the Floors, the more [Trinkets Sack] you will obtain.
If you clear the final Floor of Mirror Dungeon #3 ‘Hard’, you can earn 200 [Trinkets Sack]. If you clear the final Floor of Mirror Dungeon #3 ‘Normal’, you can earn 100 [Trinkets Sack].

※ If you have already spent your Hard Difficulty Rewards chance for the week, your ‘Hard’ Difficulty [Trinkets Sack] rewards will be the same as the Normal Difficulty Rewards.

Event Gameplay

► Main Story (Canto 1 ~ Canto 5)
If you have not fulfilled the event unlock requirements, you can obtain [Trinkets Sack] as a first-time reward from Main Story Combat Encounters. Upon first-time-completion of an Encounter, you can obtain [Trinkets Sack] proportional to the amount of Enkephalin Spent regardless of whether you’ve met the EX Clear Conditions or not.

※ You cannot obtain [Trinkets Sack] from stages that have already been completed.

※ You cannot obtain [Trinkets Sack] from Luxcavations.

<Huge Trinkets Sack>
Rarely, you may obtain [Huge Trinkets Sack] from clearing Event Stages, Main Story Stages, or Story Dungeons.
[Huge Trinkets Sack] is converted to 20 [Trinkets Sack].

‘Miracle in District 20’ Stages where you can gain [Trinkets Sack] also has a small chance to drop [Huge Trinkets Sack].

[Huge Trinkets Sack] has the highest chance to drop from the final Encounter of the event. The chance for it to drop in other Encounters is the same across all Encounters.

[Huge Trinkets Sack] is automatically converted to 20 [Trinkets Sack] in the Results or the Rewards screen upon acquisition.
