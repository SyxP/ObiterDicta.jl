Content Details

- <Refraction Railway Line 3> will open after completing Main Story 3-36, and can be accessed via the 'Drive' menu.

- As long as Line 3 is active, it can be accessed anytime without spending any resources. Line 3 will close upon the opening of <Refraction Railway Line 4>.

- You can spend a certain number of Modules(only for the first time) at the Lost & Found to claim your Refraction Railway rewards.

- Upon entering, you will choose your Identities and E.G.O. to begin the expedition with. Unlike in the previous Refraction Railway, however, any changes made to your Identities and E.G.O’s levels, Uptie Tiers, and Threadspinning Tiers after starting the run will be reflected on your active team in the Railway.

- Refraction Railway Line 3 is composed of 13 total Stations, and you will face highly difficult encounters in 10 of those Stations.

- In non-combat Stations, #4, #8, and #12, you can heal or revive your Identities. You can also modify your loadout in those Stations. Identities with 0 or positive SP will maintain their SP, but Identities with negative SP will recover to 0 SP.

- Total Turns taken to clear the Station(Clear Turns) and Total Turns taken since the First Stop to each respective Station will be shown above each Station.

- The E.G.O resources held after clearing a Station can be carried over to the next Station.

- The HP, SP, and availability of your Identities are shown at the bottom of the screen. Select the area to view your loadout.

Content Progression

- Upon defeat, you can either return to the state immediately before entering that Station or continue using your surviving Identities. Should you choose to continue, the enemies' current HP will be saved. Their remaining HP percentages will be shown above the Station.

- Upon forfeiting an Encounter, you will be returned to the state immediately before entering this stage.

- If you choose to ‘continue’ using your surviving identities, a ‘Reset’ button will be added to the Stage Info page. Select it to return to the state immediately before entering that Station for the first time.

- During an expedition, you can choose to start over(rewind) from previously cleared Stations. When you do so, the Encounter will start with the Sinners’ statuses and E.G.O resources reverted to the point of your initial entry to that Station, and the completion progress for any Stations you've cleared since that Station will be reset.

Combat Progression

※ The above image is for demonstration purposes only and is subject to change before the official release.

- A maximum of 6 Sinners may enter an encounter. Although you may do so with fewer than 6 Sinners, they will not gain additional Skill Slots.

- All encounters will be Focused Encounters where you, the Manager, will manually match your allies’ Skills against the enemies’ Skills.

- Unlike in Refraction Railway Line 2, the Identities’ Speed, Skills on the Dashboard, used Skills of individual Identities, and remaining Skills will not be saved between each Station in Refraction Railway Line 3.

However, their Resistance and any information different from their original counterparts will be locked upon your first encounter with them on the Railway.

- The damage bonus based on Observation Levels does not apply in Refraction Railway Line 3.
