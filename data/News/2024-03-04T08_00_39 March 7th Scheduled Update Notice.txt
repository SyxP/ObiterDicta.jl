Major Changes

1. Refraction Railway Line 3 clear record recovery for erroneously marked records (marked as 0 turns)

The data error [Issue where the Refraction Railway clear record is displayed as 0 Turns], as informed with the Feb. 2nd Notice, will be corrected.

- Changed Content: Affected Managers' records displayed on their respective Banners & logs will now reflect the correct value. We will withdraw the relevant reward from Managers who have unlocked the sub-100 turns reward due to this error.

We will notify affected Managers (who will have their records changed or will have their sub-100 turns reward withdrawn) separately via the in-game inbox.
