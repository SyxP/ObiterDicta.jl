Notice: Change Linked Accounts Function

Hello, this is Project Moon.

We would like to inform you of a new function we plan to add to the game: 'change linked accounts'.

Once this function is added, you can change the accounts linked to your in-game UID.

â€» However, this function is usable only once every 6 months. Also, you must remain linked to at least 1 of the following accounts: Steam, Google, or Apple.

Please note that, should you request via email to change or unlink a linked account during the period in which linked account change is unavailable, we may require more detailed verification information before proceeding with the account switch/unlinking.

Until now, we have not allowed linked Steam, Google, or Apple account switching or unlinking in order to prevent unmitigated game account sharing or sales. It was allowed only in rare cases of hacked accounts.

However, since we have been processing these account switching or unlinking requests via email requests and under conditions in which the verification for the hacked account wasn't clear, we would like to add the 'change linked account' function to improve the convenience of switching the linked accounts.

Please refer to the information below for more details.
