PROJECT MOON
1. Season 1 Egoshard Carryover

Guide on Season Changes - Egoshards

- When a new Season begins, half of the previous Season’s Egoshards will be carried over (and rounded up).
- The carryover rates for unconverted Egoshards from multiple seasons past will be halved for each following Season.
- The remaining Egoshards are converted into Thread.
- Egoshard Crates (both random and nominable) will be carried over in the same way.

As described above, half of the currencies listed below will be converted to Season 2’s.
- Season 1 [Sinner]’s Egoshard
- Season 1 Egoshard Crate
- Season 1 Nominable Egoshard Crate

The carryover of currencies to Season 2 will automatically occur the first time you log into the game during Season 2. A popup will show how much Season 1 currency you owned, and how they have been converted. Season 1 currencies still in the mailbox will only be converted after they are claimed. If you receive Season 1 currencies through the mailbox during Season 2, automatically converted upon redemption into Season 2 currency.

PROJECT MOON
2. Gradual Main Story & Battle Pass Updates

Chapter 4 of the main story and the Season 2 pass will be updated in three parts.

▶6/1
- Main Story Ch. 4 (Part 1)
- Season 2 Pass Rewards (Lv. 1 ~ Lv. 20)

▶6/8
- Main Story Ch. 4 (Part 2)
- Season 2 Pass Rewards (Lv. 21 ~ Lv. 40)

▶6/15
- Main Story Ch. 4 (Part 3)
- Season 2 Pass Rewards (Lv. 41 ~ Lv. 60 (+Max Pass Level))

The Pass Level will be tracked normally regardless of the gradual updates. When the rewards for higher levels are unlocked with subsequent updates, you can immediately claim them up to your current Pass Level. Max Pass level rewards earned for leveling up the pass beyond Level 60 are also kept track of even while they aren’t unlocked, and you can claim the accumulated rewards of Season 2 Nominable Egoshard Crates immediately once they are. Chapter 4 stage progress rewards and Max Pass level rewards will become available to claim on the June 15th update, when Part 3 of the chapter is added.

PROJECT MOON
3. New Tier for Uptying and Threadspinning

Refraction Railway Line 2 is planned to be added in mid-July**; along with it, Identity Uptie Tier 4 and E.G.O Threadspin Tier 4 will be added.
The new tier will make Identities and E.G.O more powerful.
Uptying and Threadspinning an Identity or E.G.O to Tier 4 will cost the Sinner's Egoshards as well as Thread.

Uptie·Threadspin Tier   Currencies Required

Tier 1 => Tier 2
Tier 2 => Tier 3                                      Thread
                         
Tier 3 => Tier 4                                      Thread + [Sinner]'s Egoshards

4. Identity Level Cap Increase

With the Season 2 update, the max level of Identities will increase from 30 to 35.

4/14

PROJECT MOON
5. <Ideality Exchange> for Extractions

With the Season 2 update, the Ideality Exchange system will be added for target extractions. During an extraction banner, you can gain Isang (Ideality) (理想の!사) based on the number of extractions you've performed. After collecting a certain amount of Ideality, you can exchange it for a 3★ Identity or E.G.O represented in the target extraction. Ideality is not shared between target extraction banners; Ideality in each target extraction is considered as its own currency. After the target extraction is over, the remaining Ideality is converted to Thread.

PROJECT MOON
6. Season 2 Extractions & Dispenser

Guide on Season Changes - Extractions

- A new Season's Identities and E.G.O will be added to the list of Extractable items.
